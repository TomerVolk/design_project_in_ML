and at the beginnings of the 21st century the wound is not fully healed and whole communities	and each generation has a responsibility to write a new chapter in the unfinished story of freedom
and because frivolous lawsuits raised the cost of health care the president wants to reform the medical liability system	time to play with their kids time to take care of their parents or to volunteer in their communities
and because higher education is a lifelong dream for so many president bush wants more pell grants to be available so that more americans can get their college diploma	we 've been through a lot together in the last four years and these have also been times of change that require new ideas to help move america forward

and for that i am grateful and i know you are as well	they sometimes do say a lot but when they speak people do listen
and for the sake of our own security we will not stand by and let it happen	they 've cited the cases of beirut in the ' 80s and somalia in the ' 90s
and for the very first time in all of history more people on this planet live under democracy than dictatorship	great rewards will come to those who can live together learn together work together forge new ties that bind together
and forgive me but i think they owe you an explanation	and walking this fine line requires government to be strictly neutral

and his summer job that do be embarrassed now	well i got to introduce dick at that convention
and i 'd been hanging around down there a long time	and we have the option not to decide and just drift
and i 'm confident that seven months from now with sharp alternatives before them the american people will choose the confident steady principled leadership of george bush	american workers and businesses welcomed the tax relief of the last several years and they have put that money to better use than the government would have
and i 'm glad that we have been a part of that	so here we are now almost seven years into this grand experiment

and i appreciate the leadership they 've had	and so this is a team of character
and i believe if president kennedy were still representing that seat in congress he would endorse it as well	that they should support a new more modern version of trade adjustment assistance that will work for this time
and i believe that well my generation and there were a few other generations between mine and yours	and this is directed to the young people of our country who are here with us this evening

and i put a good man in charge my friend and your friend tony principi	if you 've worn the uniform you know just how efficiently government can sometimes work

and i said well i might want to go somewhere else someday	but we 've got to have the money to do this research
and i say it shall and it will be a world of freedom but it will be only if we do our job for america so that america can do its job for the world in its position of world leadership	the reason you folks came west or your parents came west or your grandparents came west or your grandparents were the first the reason you did was that you wanted to build a better life for your children you wanted progress
and i say to you at the present time americans have learned their lesson and they 're not going to make the mistake again of giving up territory in advance to communism anyplace in the world	and here may i say that i just had the opportunity to read this morning in the paper of a statement that senator kennedy made yesterday about a couple of islands far off in the pacific
and i say to you enough is enough	how do we see this immorality turned around
and i still believe that we have made the right decision in not committing our own troops to become embroiled in this conflict in europe nor to join the united nations operations	for the past two and a half years the united states has sought to contain and end the conflict to help to preserve the bosnian nation as a multistate entity multiethnic entity
and i still believe that when it comes to defining the future the american public will be with the new democratic party instead of the right wing of the republican party which is driving their agenda	they all stuck with the nra and the republican congressional leadership when we tried to close the gun show loophole after we proved that background checks do not undermine people 's legitimate hunting and sporting interests
and i strongly believe that meaningful real tax relief can ignite another generation of growth	the world will know this that i strongly and my administration strongly supports free trade

and i want to thank my friend secretary gates for his unique willingness to serve two presidents of different parties with differing views a testimony to bob 's patriotism his commitment to service and above all his determination to see this effort through	they have always been engaged but now they 're moving to the forefront people like erin eddy a former peace corps volunteer in ecuador who now serves outside the wire as a public diplomacy officer on a regional provincial reconstruction team in kirkuk
and i want to thank our mexican and canadian friends for working with us to jointly develop	and i want to thank you all for being good stewards of the nation 's scarce resources

and i want you to help us do that	african american drivers pulled over because they look suspicious

and i will never forget you and i 'll never stop fighting for you	i have visited your homes i visited your churches i visited your community halls

and i wo prejudge well yes i will	again it has been blocked in the senate
and i wo rest until we know that every single child has someplace to go and something positive to do when they get out of school	and we 've had five years of declining crime in the country as a whole the lowest crime rate in 24 years in the united states
and i worked as hard as i could to turn this country around get it going in the right direction and that 's really what i want to have	eight years ago when we were in deep trouble the economy was down society was divided we had all kinds of difficulties everybody knew what we had to do
and i would ask them all to please stand	they had held on but not without a price
and i would like to ask all four of them to stand and be recognized now	there will be five times as many by the year 2000 perhaps more doing everything conceivable
and i would like to tell you that he gave a very fine speech on the humanities even though these were not among his strongest subjects in college	but it did cause dick concern because he was committed to speak to you today and he woke up this morning sort of croaking and making some noises
and if everybody else had done that they 'd have found the results more satisfactory	and we do have all the answers because a lot of the problems are new
and if i can remember what it was like way back there that 's quite a test of memory	this antiprotectionist and antigrowth message is something i 'll be taking to other stops today in your great state
and if not there from experience i can tell you there will be a lot of meetings with congressional leadership in which you can use that	after 8 years of working together we know that george bush will be a great president who will continue and expand what we have built together
and if people can work we would have half the problems we 've got in this country	in 12 years 12 years we went from a 1 trillion to a 4 trillion national debt
and if she did have an idea a minute	i was always looking for things i could do
and if they say you need the care your health care plan must provide it period	and let me be specific again about the type of bill i 'd like to sign
and if we can not stand for our core values then we are not keeping faith with the documents that are enshrined in this hall	we see that above all in the recent debate how the recent debate has obscured the truth and sends people into opposite and absolutist ends
and if you 're interested call 877	but some do know where to help
and if you can win those races for the gipper	please see that they all get back there with us
and if you have any doubt about that just look at what we did for the hula hoop	and your support for this is going to make a huge difference in helping us get this done
and if you would mind standing i wish you would please	senator ted stevens i appreciate so very much you being here
and in a time of challenge america needs and america has a president we can count on to get it right	these are not times for leaders who shift with the political winds saying one thing one day and another the next
and in a way that 's a happy thing for america because you do have to guess this time	those kids need people like you and we need more kids with more seniors helping them one on one
and in fact here today i want to acknowledge 40 of those people who are sitting in the front rows here oh this is the 40	that when you move into a new place that you learn about your community that you introduce yourself and you not just talk but you listen
and in our democracy political will is a renewable resource	it is about our capacity to transcend our own limitations
and in spite of all the changes which have happened since 1931 since alan entered parliament oh yes times have changed there have been certain things which have been unchanging throughout those years and that is the undaunted spirit of the british people	and with that united nations resolution behind us we know we either have to persuade argentine to withdraw or we in fact have in the end to be prepared to use force for those things which i said liberty and justice and duty
and in this second term president bush will also continue nominating federal judges who faithfully interpret the law instead of legislating from the bench	first out of basic fairness there must be no changes in social security for those now receiving benefits and for those close to retirement
and in this second term president bush will continue nominating federal judges who faithfully interpret the law instead of legislating from the bench	even allowing for the economic impact of the hurricane on the gulf coast our economy is resilient and still on an upward path

and in your political activities since this is a political meeting it means that every american be he democrat or republican should not only vote for the man or woman of his choice but he should also work for that man so that the selection that is made represents the best thinking of the total american voting population	he said vice president i want to express to you and to nixon my appreciation for your stopping at our school he said i trust that you will extend my best wishes and those of our students here to the students that you meet in the united states on your return and i answered him in this way
and instead of being in a vast church we worship at on sunday morning with about 50 people and about six or seven people singing in the choir	first pastor and cherry on behalf of my wife my daughter and all of our company here thank you so much for making us feel at home today
and it 's important for you to understand that	or maybe somebody says i should deal with it
and it does have to	she has two young children
and it has already been confirmed by the blood of patriots and the sacrifice of generations of americans	and even though it may lead you to doubt my credibility i 've got to point it out
and it has to do with me and guys like yarbrough	a lot of people said you should talk about it president
and it is now my distinct and extraordinary honor to ask each of them to come forward to receive their award as a military aide reads their citation	so determined to help mohammed yunus left the classroom for a village and discovered that just 27 would free dozens of artisans vendors and rickshaw pullers from debt
and it is that that i ask for the opportunity today for you to decide	we 've heard a lot of concern expressed about america 's position in the world
and it is unacceptable for our country	and health care is a perfect example
and it is wrong	circuit court of appeals
and it looks to me like he qualifies just on that ground alone	it 's the straw poll conducted at the december state convention in florida
and it means igniting a new economy that generates good jobs right here in the united states and starts freeing ourselves from dependence on foreign oil	we were going through the worst crisis since the great depression and we had to make sure that we did slip into a second great depression
and it must act now	now we know the facts
and it ought to be that way for everybody all across the country	now we 've been working on getting an energy bill through the congress
and it saves on our deficits	that 's what this is about
and it seems to me the best line i could give all of you at this great jewish event tonight is happy patrick 's day	to ambassador yaacobi rabinovich members of the young leadership cabinet and all of you thank you for giving me the opportunity to come by tonight
and it should not be a small matter to the united states congress	and those benefits are scheduled to rise dramatically over the next few decades
and it strengthens our commitment to see that such a terrible thing never occurs again	all of you know well the sad and difficult history of the battle of okinawa
and it was the right decision to make	but we 're not going go weaken it
and just last week remarkably the kuwaiti legislature granted its women citizens the right to vote	today citizens in the region are demanding that their governments respond to this simple audacious question
and just yesterday we learned that our exports of american cars to japan increased 40 percent in just one year last year	our security as individuals communities and a nation depends upon our policies to fight terrorism crime and drugs at home and abroad
and ladies and gentlemen it 's my great honor to present to you the president of the united states	and incidentally partly because of this we were able to have the success announced yesterday with the crime bill
and let 's do everything that we can to give our kids the future that we want for them and we know they deserve	and that 's why i 'm here with all of you because you all have a vitally important role to play in this effort
and let 's win this fight	so here 's the bottom line
and let me colonel by the way on behalf of everybody thank you	vice president we 've recently seen scandals of and some of the others
and let me please make a toast to my host	that was the promise of mexico 's struggle for independence
and let us not forget that progress when we talk of the difficulties	it was in 1995 that you first came to northern ireland as president
and like me he married above himself	i really do enjoy working with denny
and like your ancestors your greatest power is the ability to inspire a new generation of women and girls	we too can contribute to the spread of liberty by teaching our children tolerance and respect for all people
and lives will be saved	even by motorcycle or bicycle
and lynne is here too of course	well we 're delighted to be home
and maine has an excellent community college system	there are more single moms doing double duty
and many women find themselves doing the same thing for their spouses	and that 's why i 'd like to talk to you today
and may god continue to bless america	freedom is finding allies in every country
and may i say as a former secretary of defense that i 've never been more proud of the american military	we are also expanding our maritime interdiction operations to prevent the illegal movement of personnel arms and equipment into our country
and medicare and social security have long term problems that we 're going to solve	we must respond and act with courage to keep medicare and social security benefits secure
and more than men and women born in mexico now wear the uniform of the united states military	more than 25 million men and women of mexican origin now make their homes in the united states
and most of all to my partners my wife and two children god bless you and thank you very much	she promoted innovation and research and acted to protect the environment while making energy safe and reliable and cost effective
and my own sons the pride of my life david holbrooke and anthony holbrooke both now television producers for all of you i will say great television producers in new york	it will not be easy for my wife kati and me to follow bill and barbara richardson who have left such a vivid mark on the united nations and new york
and my predecessor the very first vice president john adams actually did that a few times and then they withdrew his floor privileges	it 's a pleasure to come to utah with your outstanding congressional delegation men like chris cannon and rob bishop in the house
and now	all right
and now even my cat socks has his own page	but for others it 's a time of profound insecurity
and now even though i 'm going to change subjects here i 'm still preaching to the choir	and there 's one subject i wish the hearings had dealt with more thoroughly and that 's crime
and now finally let me just add a few words about the controversy concerning iran or have you heard about it	this country is great and our freedom is sure as long as we continue to have a federation of sovereign states
and now i 'd like to introduce to you a very special young woman melanie musick	i think it 's symbolic that members of congress could stand up to a large lobby
and now i know you have other things to do so do	i was in the principal 's office once in dixon high school
and now it 's our time to ask what if what if we find a breakthrough to cure parkinson 's diabetes alzheimer 's and aids	and if we honor them if we believe in ourselves we can build an america that is stronger at home and respected in the world
and now it is my honor to sign the protect act of 2003	no child should ever have to experience the terror of abduction or worse
and now those children are receiving a real education without the hateful propaganda of saddam hussein	we 're training a new army an army that defends the people instead of terrorizes them
and of course there 's an individual whose very name causes liberals to break out in a nervous rash	we accomplished this and at the same time kept inflation lower than it 's been for over 20 years
and oftentimes this is true	our communities soon become overcrowded
and on one occasion i was about to say to him very sternly mondale you are taxing my patience	you know he 's done a lot of talk lately that there 's a new and an older reagan
and on that point	everybody 's for peace
and on wednesday you heard my the chancellor in confident mood	our overseas assets have multiplied more than sixfold in six years
and once i assured the seniors that did mean they had to stay another year in high school	there are over vacancies in information technology today in america with an average starting salary of a year
and one of the favorite quotes i remember secretary was there is nothing like a hanging to focus one 's attention	but it 's you all of you in this audience here who are in the position to make it a reality
and one of the things that i have learned in ways large and small over an unfortunately increasingly elderly existence	and in which virtually everybody has some trouble balancing work and family during the period of the child 's life
and one of the things that i hope will happen this year if you 'll forgive me i wo give you a speech tonight because i know i 'm preaching to the saved as we say at home	i believe that in the years ahead the threat of a nuclear war which hung over us in the cold war between russia and the united states will probably continue to abate unless something really dumb is done
and one of them is how important it is for the hard working people of this country to get to keep as much of their paychecks as possible	i have known him since he was 14 years old and his job that summer was sweeping out the ben franklin store in our home town casper wyoming
and one senator stormed into my office one day and he said i think he said there is no excuse for giving back that public money to the people	so when american business created new wealth for the country it flowed to the american people and was not diverted to washington to fund new bureaucracies and spending programs
and our children have responsibilities that they have to meet	but to paraphrase king education is an either or proposition
and our job is to hand you an america that is free in a country or a world that is at peace	we 're a people in short who do need the supervision of government sophisticates to tell us what is right and good
and our proposal provides a substantial increase in funds to support those kinds of activities	we ca do that unless people at the grass roots participate and take the lead
and our troops are doing great work	we 're making progress here at home
and plus you 've got to do all that while keeping the hometown folks happy	today modern technology is opening up greater and greater opportunities for state and local government
and president america will meet the test	it does matter how long it takes
and put america on the path to eliminating our national debt completely by the year 2012	we need a president who is willing to stand up and take on the special interests
and raising our girls in the white house with my mom oh not going to do this	she 's pulled me back when i 've run out of line talking a little too much
and see the thing is	we ca do it alone
and she ought to be rewarded for it	they have not been treated fairly or adequately
and she said yeah a lot of them are quitting because it 's too much hassle now	first we 're making the law of the land what is already the law in every state
and should the rest of us ask him where have you been while all this has been going on and what are you doing about it	with it goes a feeling that parliament which ought to be in charge is not in charge that the actions and the decisions are taken elsewhere
and since april this month is the month of the military child i want to salute all our military children	but what i want you to know is that these words of thanks are backed up by deeds as well
and since he got such a weak reception when he walked in i think that	and senator wyden raised the issue of modifying the tax exclusion for higher income americans
and sixth we should always remember every dollar we spend is the taxpayer 's money	third we must confront the tough problems not avoid them and leave them for others
and so do farmers all across america	farm equity and land values are strong
and so i raise my glass president in a toast to you and walesa and to the people of poland	in poland that means a stronger economy and greater security and more concern for those who have been left behind
and so i would say to you that	i would just like to point out something
and so it is wonderfully fitting to see the children of mexico as well as i suspect a few children of the united states here together waving flags of both countries because we are reminded	all across america all across the united states we have benefitted from the culture the language the food the insights the literature the energy the ambitions of people who have migrated from our southern neighbor
and so president if you want to talk about the insiders you 've fought for versus the kids and families that i 've fought for here 's my message to you it on	you know the president has attacked me over and over for having spent 20 years of my life fighting for kids and victims and families against the most powerful opposition big insurance companies
and so they have obligations to one another which they recognize	that 's the depth of the change that is going on
and so thomas tell people what you do	and these are exciting times they really are
and somebody told me that former senator mark hatfield is with us today	i thank my friend gordon smith for his leadership on this important project
and someone long ago once said those are cobblestones they 're irish heads	that 's all right because after january we 'll just call him senator
and still even though he 's not in public service and now that he 's not in my employ sometimes with greater color	later he was inspired by the activism of caesar chavez and went down to florida to defend poor farm workers against labor abuses
and sudan 's government must understand that ending its sponsorship of terror outside sudan is no substitute for efforts to stop war inside sudan	the united states is committed to helping african nations put an end to regional wars that take tens of thousands of lives each week
and thank you all for being here	dancing is bigger than the physical body
and thank you to the endowment	you truly are doing extraordinary work
and thanks to the honor and the heroism of our troops we are poised to end our combat mission in iraq this summer on schedule	today we send out our thoughts and prayers to all the folks from pensacola on the frontlines at this very moment including iraq and afghanistan
and thanks to you president george bush won the greatest number of popular votes of any presidential candidate in history	we remain grateful for all that you did and i appreciate the chance to be here today to say so
and that 's a new departure	but we never went beyond that
and that 's another reason i 'm very proud of the state of georgia for trying to lead the way	and i want to compliment georgia for its magnet schools and for the charter school program you 've just started
and that 's exactly how he plans to lead the country for the next four years	he did go to washington to mark time or to spend his energy on small goals
and that 's exactly how he will continue to lead the country for the next four years	we plan to double the number of workers trained through the federal government 's job training program
and that 's exactly how he will continue to lead the nation for the next four years	he did go to the white house to mark time or to waste energy on small goals
and that 's exactly what we have in rob portman of cincinnati	and that increased economic activity generates more revenue for the federal government
and that 's important	you deserve the credit
and that 's important for the future	and that 's the issue of trucking
and that 's it in a nutshell	there is any question about goals here
and that 's one of the reasons we wanted to come	first i would like to ask a question of president clinton
and that 's part of what 's needed but also	so i 've presented a realistic budget to the congress
and that 's something that america can be proud of	we were coming to grips with the demands of change
and that 's something to be proud of	so we 're moving in the right direction
and that 's something we can all be proud of because i know youthbuild was in the middle of that work	and if you remember during the transition we 're still transitioning he enlisted colin powell in a bipartisan call to service
and that 's something you can be proud of	i can not tell you how important this is
and that 's starting to happen all across the midwest	it means giving smart tax breaks to small business owners
and that 's the basis that i present our case to you	now i want to come to the heart of my message today
and that 's the thing you 've got to bear in mind	both of whom have sat down across the conference table from him
and that 's what barbara boxer has always stood for	some of those differences were expressed in the republican caucus
and that 's what is at stake in this election	it 's different than anything we 've ever fought before
and that 's what we 're doing with the auto industry	and that 's the challenge we faced when i took office
and that 's what we will do	i do think it 's rightly fair
and that 's why a group of community leaders and local churches got together and started what they call peaches and greens	the folks in washington do have the kind of personal relationships or that it takes to get things done on the ground
and that 's why i 've come today	you know what i 'm talking about jesse
and that 's why i came here today	but we choose to stay here and work
and that 's why i keep asking you for your help	the contras are made up of many of those other revolutionaries
and that 's why new jersey needs to give jon corzine another four years	so i know these are challenging times and jon knows these are challenging times
and that 's why today i 'm signing an executive order strengthening the white house initiative on historically black colleges and universities	endowments and state budgets are shrinking too many facilities are deteriorating enrollment is falling and the cost of education keeps going up
and that 's why we 're not going to walk away from it	more small businesses are going to be priced out of the insurance market
and that after 2 years in federal office is hard to do	but human rights means working at problems not walking away from them
and that bill has been buried for more than 2 years in a committee of the house of representatives under the direction of tip o ' neill	if america could bring down inflation from percent to 4 percent then we can bring it down from 4 to and we 're going to do that
and that certainly is something we can all agree on as americans today	all of these costs are included as a part of our farm program
and that has to be true of republicans as well as democrats	just yesterday the congressional budget office finally decided to ' fess up
and that is exactly what we ought to do	but i do think that is a good idea
and that is our objective	we serve not only ourselves
and that is what the program is all about	we have to have rigorous academics and practical learning
and that is why i 've asked congress to fund our efforts to find out why the water is falling to restore the great lakes waterways to improve our stewardship of this vital resource	but the scientists also say that a significant degree of this climate change is due to human activity specifically to putting more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere from the burning of coal and oil
and that is why they deserve respect for their human rights	this issue is not one issue for some special interest group
and that is why we will prevail	the outcome of this struggle is certain
and that ladies and gentlemen is exactly the kind of man we have in the white house today	we intend to make good use of every day we have the honor of serving the american people
and that ladies and gentlemen is exactly the kind of man we have in the white house today in president george bush	we 'll take nothing for granted and we will continue making good use of every day that we serve the american people
and that means investing in the clean energy jobs of the future	i 'm confident that we 're going to weather this economic storm
and that meant a great deal to me	both places believed in hard work and opportunity
and that must be our urgent task to restore that tomorrow for our young people	most of our people are citizens who love their families more than their own lives
and that tax bill was absolutely vital	so that 's my only real job
and that to secure liberty at home it must be defended abroad	today a new generation that never experienced oppression is coming of age
and that took several minutes	it 's about mark twain
and that will be the priority of the budget i submit to the united states congress	next week i will go before congress to lay out my priorities for the coming year
and that will help a lot of you in this room	we have to do things like that all across the country
and the answer is that the security of the united states must come before all other considerations	in determining what level of military strength we need we must look at it from two standpoints
and the best way to reach that goal is through voluntary personal retirement accounts	we must make social security permanently sound not leave that task for another day
and the end of the present regime in iraq would create such an opportunity	the united states and other nations are working on a road map for peace
and the judicial branch has no business directing national security policy for this country	the very nature of executive decisions as to foreign policy is political not judicial
and the north carolina people ought to be thanking him for his leadership as well	we 've got barbaras have a sweet spot in our heart in the bush family
and the only way to do that in our country is to give people the benefit of free or reduced television radio newspaper other communications time in return for cutting the cost of their campaign	i personally do think it 's a bad thing for a person who has done well in this country and believes in politics and wants to contribute something back to be able to do that
and the other thing we 've done at the administrative level is we sent money back to the people who pay the bills in america	but i must confess i 'm worried about the fact that our manufacturing sector in our economy is a lot slower than i would hope
and the third thing i want to say is only the democrats want you to know what the differences are	so the reason it 's so important is i do know when we 'll ever have another chance like this
and the time to act is now	i know you 've seen the news
and the united states is in a position to stand against it and we ought to	it 's all right to rape the daughters it 's all right to shoot the sons
and the united states will never seek a permission slip to defend the security of our country	from the beginning america has sought and received international support for our operations in iraq and afghanistan
and then he did a couple of times and they withdrew his floor privileges	and of course we 've got an outstanding state chairman now in kevin mannix
and then i 'm going to sign it	we 're closer than we 've ever been
and then they said let 's roll	this is a matter of political parties
and then we 'll bring our troops home with victory	they know what is at stake and so do we
and then when we got home we 'd be sent right back outside and told not to come back home until dinner was served	like how one in three kids today will eventually develop diabetes and in the african american and hispanic communities the number is nearly half
and there are going to be more people employed here than before	the old way of doing things was to mandate regulate and litigate
and there are other hey hey hey hey hey hey hey	when the ice melts on land the sea level goes up
and there are still altogether too many of them	the united states has pushed very hard for it
and there can be no doubt that george bush is serious about fighting it and winning it	but when it came up for renewal last year senate democrats tried to block it by filibuster
and there is no doubt in my mind that this great nation will indeed prevail thank you very much	today confronted yet again by a host of challenges we can and we will achieve success across the board
and there will be further measures to come	some 11 million people have become occupational pensioners
and there you 're going to see the greatest miracle you ever	well let me tell you what 's going to happen to me
and these are big ideas	otherwise it 's highway safety
and these are the men and women who our nation will honor forever	the methods of war have changed but the need for courage has not
and they 're fighting among themselves	and that is a remarkable achievement
and they have done all of this with the bravery and the honor we would expect of them	unfortunately we 've had more than 300 of our troops killed in action during the war on terror
and they made predictions then more predictions than the tv weatherman	i think i can sympathize with what george is up against
and they refused to cooperate because kristol told them it was bad politics	he told them for example to stop cooperating with us on health care
and they speak of government as if it 's our warm fuzzy auntie come to take care of us	i do think there 's anybody in this country that disagrees with that or at least not many people
and they told you you had to sacrifice more and that we were now in an age of limits	what they know is that when jerry ford left office the prime interest rate was 6 1 4 percent
and they vote for senator ted kennedy for reelection in massachusetts	in that sense our nation is very much like a person
and this is a good thing for america	three were in the arkansas ozarks our appalachia
and this is all part of a major effort	they can have a harder time focusing at school
and this is just the beginning of the discussion	that 's the good thing about farmers ' markets
and this is not a democratic issue or a republican issue	the indefensible contracts that cost taxpayers billions and make contractors rich
and this is one victory in the war against terror	many of our good citizens profess no religion at all
and this is our theme throughout	that is how you got in
and this transformation will help make america more secure	economic life is being restored to cities of iraq
and to finally pay both our dues and our debts to the united nations	i say again the inexorable logic of globalization is the genuine recognition of interdependence
and to keep it moving forward we need to continue the agenda of president george bush for four more years	and in the time ahead we need the same steadfast presidential leadership that we have had over the last years
and to keep it moving forward we need to continue the economic policies of president george bush	as goli and jim know well the security of our nation has to be our first concern
and to many of you if you 'll forgive me this is directed to our young people who are here with us today	we 're going to keep cracking down until you and your families and your friends can walk our city streets without being afraid
and today of course saddam hussein is in jail	and we 've now stood up an interim government
and today we 're releasing our national hiv aids strategy which is the product	she inspired her son who was born healthy to become an aids activist himself
and today we learned that the economy grew at a rate of percent in the second quarter of this year	it increases family budgets through tax relief provided immediate relief on the child tax credit and marriage penalty tax relief
and under the determined leadership of president george bush that is exactly what we will do	i think as a nation we are facing one of the great challenges in our history
and we 'll see you tomorrow at lunch	you know she says this is all me
and we 're fortunate to have them as friends	and thanks to both of them for their friendship
and we 're going to do our best to give it to you	you never hear anybody griping about going through an airport metal detector anymore
and we 're not afraid of that	so look at the fight in washington
and we 're now trying to get the congress to allow taxpayers to deduct the cost of college tuition up to from their tax bill which will be worth a year in lower taxes for families with kids in college	but there is nothing more important for us to do if we want to use this moment to build a future of our dreams for our kids than to make sure all of our children get a 21st century education
and we 're very proud of that	jobs upgrading a smarter stronger power grid
and we 're working closely with the lawmakers to make this bill a priority early early in the next session of congress	already there are more than fewer people working for the federal government than there were on the day i was inaugurated president
and we 've done this because we believe that when families and small businesses are hurting the best way to help them is to let them keep more of what they earn	one of the most important commitments george bush made during the 2000 campaign was that the armed forces would be given every resource they need and all of the respect they deserve
and we 've got to get rid of it	people from other countries ask me all the time
and we are determined to see that it be done	and i appreciate that what all of you have done
and we are going to do that	we have a long way to go
and we are going to succeed	i hear these stories every day
and we are move faster on do ask do tell	these problems that we confronted did come out of nowhere
and we are really glad you are here	i want to thank our host ryan seacrest
and we both married above ourselves	there 's a lot to do
and we ca just declare that our kids need to get more exercise when they do have parks to play in or safe streets to walk on	i think it means that we as a community and as a nation need to make solving childhood obesity a top priority for our kids ' future
and we can find it for america if you will let us do so	we 've just got to along with this and so forth and so on
and we can solve this problem as well	he will not stand up to powerful supporters
and we do believe in the federalization of the public school system that one size does not fit all when it comes to education	one of the things that i talked about with the governors all of whom were here the other day was a new federalism initiative
and we expect every school to teach the basics of reading and math	we 're reducing the taxes on dividends and capital gains to encourage investment
and we expect every single child to learn in america	let me tell you what i think the bill says
and we gave our young people some things to say yes to as well as to say no to because these police officers said we had to have more prevention in education programs in our schools if we wanted a safe america for the next generation	a year ago when the crime bill was enacted those of us who supported it i believe exercised our responsible our personal responsibility to the young people of america to do everything we could to ensure their safety and to provide alternatives to crime and violence
and we had better get about solving it as a family	king said men hate each other because they fear each other
and we had better take this chance and make the most of it	all groups are sharing in the prosperity by income by region by race
and we had better wake up soon and put the breaks on or there 'll be no turning back	we have forgotten apparently even how to teach them to discriminate between what is right and what is wrong
and we have a good partnership with pasada	parents who will watch their children grow up
and we have been defended by some of the bravest men and women this nation has ever known	and with george bush leading the nation we are serious and we will not let down our guard
and we have got to find ways to give them that chance	we 've revolutionized the meat standards so you can have safer meat
and we have proposed to you can clap for that i like that	and there is a very ambitious agenda of political reform before the congress
and we hope we get him before he has a chance to leave	he was running one of the training camps in afghanistan before 9 11
and we kind of noticed it	we almost entered the other lane
and we must defeat them	to intimidate all western countries
and we must do the same	what do we believe is right
and we must give parents and children better options if our schools fail to teach and will not change	the growth of our economy also depends not only on real meaningful tax reductions but also on increasing productivity
and we must strengthen the moral and spiritual heritage of america if we are to lead the free world to peace and freedom in the years ahead	and because the program that we stand for has been built on this principle that 's why we 've had tremendous progress in these last 8 years
and we need to keep moving forward	we are moving forward in head start
and we need to reward that not punish it	that 's about what i need to do today
and we ought to be driven by what is best for the american people	we do care what people in law enforcement who vote republican and democrat say
and we ought to pass it and pass it now because of frank and because of you	we passed a very good lobby reform bill and believe me the lobbyists are flooding registration offices
and we ought to trust them with their own money	and i said well i think you miscalculated our campaign
and we owe so much so much to the men and women our veterans who step forward to protect those freedoms	one veteran of world war ii recalled the spirit of the american military and the relief it brought to suffering peoples
and we want people as best protected as possible from those shysters who would take advantage of buyers	there are three steps i want to describe to you right quickly about what we intend to do
and we want to return with honor	we would have it any other way
and we will defeat them again	great causes are not easy causes
and we will do so	thank you all very much
and we will help if they will do that	we want to lift countries up to our level
and we will invest in online courses so that people can get the highest quality education instruction right at their kitchen table	and the program in philadelphia that teaches girls who are athletes about the science behind the sports that they 're athletes in
and we will meet our duties until the job is done	thank you all for coming for making a good courageous vote
and we will no longer be divided by george bush in the white house	we will continue to stand up against the divisive policies of the far right
and we will not rest until we reach a day when not one single veteran falls into homelessness	and that 's why this budget dramatically increases funding for mental health screening and treatment at all levels
and we will not sit back and wait to be hit again	they serve an ideology that rejects tolerance and denies freedom of conscience
and we will press ahead to implement the commitments that all made at sharm	the summit of peacemakers was the largest and meeting of its kind ever held
and when he 'd taxed the people to the hilt and when people had paid rates to the hilt and that still was enough	translating them into practice costs money and that money has to be earned by somebody and it can only be earned by creating wealth
and when i became president the average cell phone weighed five pounds	so i like to refer to this as the age of interdependence
and when i said that there was almost a groan in the congress you know because the republicans and democrats having to recognize they were percent the same	when you see the continuing efforts to resolve the future of tibet and the role of the dalai lama is that a religious conflict or an ethnic one
and when it comes to global warming we 'll do it again	we have it in our power to act right here right now
and when they do and when they 're ready our troops will come home with the honor they have earned	they asked me you know i 've been asked and they say is there a timetable of withdrawal from iraq
and when we met the royal family the first thing amy shouted was hi prince	and one of the first things i did was just send my condolences to him
and when you come back here you 've had to bark since you came back	and boss could even have caught him until later because he can outrun the boss
and whether they serve in iraq afghanistan or elsewhere in the world the brave americans on duty in this war can be proud of their service for the rest of their lives	to remove this danger to civilization we have to proceed on many fronts at the same time from law enforcement to diplomacy to military action to a global effort against weapons proliferation
and while there are encouraging signs the economy is picking up steam the president and i will not rest until everyone who wants a job can find a job	now congress must complete its work and send a bill to the president to provide seniors with better health coverage and relief from the rising cost of prescription drugs
and why a man whose father less than 60 years ago might not have been served in a local restaurant can now stand before you to take a most sacred oath	what is required of us now is a new era of responsibility a recognition on the part of every american that we have duties to ourselves our nation and the world
and with george bush leading this nation we are serious and we will prevail	never mind that the iraqi people and their elected leaders are counting on us
and with george bush there is never any doubt where he stands or what he believes	our nation can have a cleaner environment and much more diverse and reliable supply of energy
and with leaders like george kourpias	i 'll see you soon george
and with president george bush as that is exactly what we will do	this election could not come at a more crucial time in our history
and with your help he 'll do it for four more years	reach out to democrats and independents who appreciate strong and optimistic leadership
and with your help we 're going to have a solid effective effort throughout this election year and we look forward to carrying the state of oregon for the ticket	being from wyoming i thought i knew a thing about big snow and cold weather but apparently it 's nothing compared to what happened to all of you last week
and working with denny hastert we proposed and delivered tax savings to the american people not once not twice but three times	our country requires strong and consistent leadership for our actions overseas and the same is true for our policies here at home
and xboxes and playstations none of which i know how to work	and hampton that has never been more true than it is today
and yes that is why we 're going to fix the health care system	we 're going to keep fighting for rules of the road for wall street
and you all know how to do that	to funding breast cancer research stem cell research
and you ca understand jazz without understanding dave brubeck	so let 's never forget that art strengthens america
and you can not let	it 's always about tomorrow
and you do the best you can	can you hear me in the back
and you have to be willing as business people to stand up and say when somebody says well why are we spending this on health care why are we spending this on education why are we spending this on clean water why are we spending this on a road in another part of the country i 'll hear that i know about that	but keep in mind if we take the burden off the government of having to make these debt service payments then you must support the president and you must support your legislators anybody with any influence over how this is done to spend the money in a way that will grow the economy and strengthen the society of nigeria over the long run
and you know my generation and well there are a few generations between mine and yours	and this is to the young people of our country who are here with us today
and you ought to be for it	most americans do know what that is
and you owe that to them	we 're there for strategic reasons
and you send this i called this team of yours your congressman and bob and henson moore and all the louisiana	when the great depression was spread all over the world by the tariff that protectionist measure that was a republican bill
and you should be proud of that	a lot of people have forgotten that
and you should be very proud of yourselves for the role you played in it	and i am very grateful that we have the longest peacetime expansion in our history
and you should give an inch either	and this is where change gets hard
and you should welcome programs that all exist	it 's really the american spirit is it
and you will face the full wrath of the people of the united states of america and i think	and there 's no reason for us to believe at this stage that this operation is about to end
another president dared the soviets to tear down that wall	and now i am honored to visit this great city
another republican as far as i know never voted for me but he was a friend of mine	if there are pickup trucks in the parking lot i 'm not going to worry about the market
any person or government that supports protects or harbors terrorists is complicit in the murder of the innocent and will be held to account	the best intelligence is necessary not just to win the war on terror but also to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction
any texans here speaking about foreign countries	i 'm glad you all are here
anybody who says america has been standing still has been traveling around america for the last 7 years	he 'll say he stands for all these things and that he 's going to move us forward
appeasement is the road not to peace it is the road to war or surrender and we must never have that in the united states	you know the trouble is too often people think that in dealing with men like khrushchev they react like the leaders of the free world
archbishop we thank you for your devotion to all god 's children and we welcome you to your new home in the diocese of washington	two years ago i was honored to send him as one of my representatives on a trip to discuss religious freedom with china 's leaders
are we ready	let 's move
are you better off today than you were eight years ago	so we 're laughing but let me just tell you seriously
are you prepared to sit back and let them do that to america	after years of drift and decline this great nation is moving forward again
are you with me	it 's about you
as a candidate for president i pledged to bring the war in iraq to a responsible end	others stepped forward in this time of war knowing they could be sent into harm 's way
as a former secretary of defense i 've never been more proud of our men and women in uniform than i am today	nearly 400 of our troops have already given their lives since the war on terror began and there will surely be more casualties
as a former secretary of defense i 've never been prouder of our men and women in uniform than i am today	in this global war on terror forces are heavily engaged when and where they need to be especially in afghanistan and iraq
as a former secretary of defense i have never been more proud of the men and women of the united states military	we 're calling on other nations to help the iraqis build a free society which will make all of us more secure
as a friend of mine said maybe if you build it they will come	yet there are today more judicial vacancies than on the day we were inaugurated
as a parent one of the first things you learn to teach your children is what your parents taught you never make a decision when you 're mad	we are standing up for peace and freedom and democracy from northern ireland to south africa in the persian gulf and in the middle east and in haiti
as he says whenever he has to vote we win	that 's what we 've done with the brady bill
as i tell people i spend a lot of time in washington sandy 's always saying that i 've done a good job as a democrat with the economy so more people can live like republicans	of what she has done with her life and the chance that her mother took in going to hawaii the risks and the heartache and the difficulties her family went through it made you feel good
as laura would say i could use a dose occasionally	i appreciate the number of foreign dignitaries who are here
as members of the national guard you may not be soldiers but you are all patriots	the air national guard 's role in the aftermath of september 11th has been truly remarkable
as we gather for this ceremony we are thinking of the men and women in our armed forces and we are tremendously proud of their brave service to the united states	this beautiful place in the hills of east alabama with its long history and 12 fine schools and colleges has had a influence on the life of the state and country
as we move from the cold war	there are always a lot of laughs
as we restored america 's reduction of well i should say strength not reduction i 'm jumping ahead of myself here	he 's the author of the job training partnership act and thousands of americans are working today because of that legislation
as we seek to improve human life we must always preserve human dignity	well thank you all so very much for coming to the white house
as you all know i have spent a lot of time in the first year yes it 's been a year	and she 's not just working here but she has taken the time to travel with me on my special projects
ask yourselves which party could run on that platform today	so he did the honorable thing he left his party
assalaamu alaykum	good afternoon
at least the folks back in massachusetts knew he was on the job	and their idea for cheering up the country is to raise our taxes
at my age everything reminds you of a story	interest rates were the highest since the civil war
at that time we will be laying the last brick in the edifice of peace whose foundation has been established today	we know quite well that this is merely the beginning of a journey that is surrounded by numerous dangers and difficulties
at the dawn of this new century america can be proud of the progress we have made toward equality but we all must recognize we have more to do	as children of the south martin luther king and rosa parks both came to the civil rights movement with long personal experience of the evils of discrimination and segregation
at the moment any negotiating process whatsoever creates capital for terrorism creates opportunities for terror to show its power and prove its might	well because we had on one side when everybody was fawning over i do half of the time know what to call him
at their request i am using my remaining time in office to narrow the differences between the parties to the greatest degree possible	given the impasse and the tragic deterioration on the ground a couple of weeks ago both sides asked me to present my ideas
back when the war on poverty began which poverty won	we must just think that electing the president is enough
bag it and bin it and that way we 'll win it	to the quality of the legacy we pass on to our children
barbara boxer is one of those people	i 'm going to help my coworker
be fired up and be ready to go	this is where the rubber hits the road
because america loves peace america will always work and sacrifice for the expansion of freedom	yet the national interest of america involves more than eliminating aggressive threats to our safety
because i believe in you	none of this was preordained
because i tell you you can not hold someone in the ditch unless you linger there with them	in 1984 my heart is made to feel glad because i know there is a way out justice
because if we do we 're going to face the danger that this country will fall apart utterly and we will never get it back	now i 've got to tell you that it was necessary to put those issues on the table to push them and push them hard
because reform passed she is now getting treatment	denied coverage by every insurance company they tried
because that 's how you 'll end up learning what it 's like to walk in somebody else 's shoes	but that 's class of 2010 i want you to pay attention on this because that 's not what happened
because that 's the right decision	but look is bigger than 2
because there are those days when we do see those very clearly	i think that 's why in a sense god made us mortal
because we 're involved with other countries we 've been able to get some of those terrorists arrested in other countries and brought back here to stand trial for killing innocent americans because we work with them	but if you think about what the world is going to look like in the years ahead for all these children that are here it really matters if america is the strongest force for peace and freedom
because when any of our citizens	my beautiful nieces suhaila and savita
because you made yourself nonexistent	i mean nothing absolutely nothing
before you can leave he said i want you to go over to that globe and show me that you can identify your country	before 9 11 all too many nations tended to draw a distinction between terrorist groups and the states that provided these groups with support
believe me i hope i 'm like that when i get old	but i do think the american recovery is confined to economic matters
between 1977 and 1981 i do know why i pick those years	since our expansion began we 've created over 18 million new jobs
between the army engineers and the navy seabees	thanks to you we have reversed ethnic cleansing
bob have you gone out for the team yet	and i do mean in this fine new facility
both have very good governors	that is happening right here
both of us could be wrong	i 'm pretty about these things
boy that 's great	i understand you raised
bring your ideas your innovation your energy back to washington and give use a chance to do it	you also see the enormous consequences of continued neglect of continuing to do things the way they are
britain and america are more interesting countries than they were 30 years ago because they are more diverse but the only way we can really live together is if we say that the celebration of our differences requires us to say that our common humanity matters more	there are large numbers of people who simply do not have the values and vision necessary to be part of an interdependent world because they think their differences whether they are religious or political or racial or tribal or ethnic are more important than our common humanity
but a president always always casts the decisive vote	i do question his patriotism i question his judgment
but above all we are carrying out the largest programme of denationalisation in our history	for many years our vitality in britain was blunted by excessive reliance on the state
but as important we 've got enough money to let you keep your own money	i view those excuses i view those as excuses to keep your money in washington
but at least felons fugitives and stalkers could get guns	so this is something we 've got to do together
but because of senator lamberti 's leadership iowa was not one of them	and in washington he 'll be a powerful advocate for the 3rd district
but because that decision in my view undermined the trust required for productive negotiations i and at the request of president obama condemned it immediately and unequivocally	it was also difficult for the palestinian authority to take a step that it has to take to combat incitement and reform the institutions it 's reforming
but first i 'm going to give her the apple	let 's read to our kids once in a while
but forgive me i 've decided to call it a	he came up with still another one in our debate
but free and open trade is in our national interest	and the united states will not repeat the mistake again
but here he is ably leading right he 's doing a good job	that it is theirs just as much as anyone 's in this nation
but i 'd like to introduce you to betty jean spencer and anne and arthur johnson	their daughter stephanie a student was returning to school in maryland when her car broke down
but i 'll tell you something there 's over crooks that could get a gun because we passed the brady bill	we have a school down the street from our apartment my boy ca walk to school unless i go with him
but i 'm here to tell you today you ai seen nothin ' yet	we can not simply ignore the hard won lessons of the past eight years
but i 'm telling you and i 'd like to sort of ride off into the sunset singing happy trails	if you keep more guns out of the hands of criminals and children you do have as many people dying
but i am also absolutely convinced as my daughter 's generation says that denial is not simply a river in egypt	it is a living thing made out of the disposition of people to create and distribute the good things of life
but i am grateful to you for being able to stand and say hello i think you are here for the same reason that i am because this is an important election because we are democrats because we believe in progress and because we are going to win	i come here today to queens and ask your help in moving this country forward in building our strength in building our influence abroad in identifying our selves once again as the great defender of freedom at a time when freedom is under attack all over the globe
but i believe it 's still in the hearts of the american people	that becomes a sound foundation for discipline in our use of our freedoms
but i believe that indiana and the rest of the united states are going to choose in 1960 to look forward again to put their confidence in the democratic party which in other days in other years in other crises has produced leadership and has moved this country off dead center	there is no business in indiana that does not sell to the rest of the country and if the rest of the country is standing still if our economy is not moving forward where are all the young men and women going to school in this state going to find jobs
but i do think it would be good to make sure	we do talk about how best to modernize the border security
but i kind of it was a gas that he would try to give the people of new york the impression that i 'd prefer him to my wife in the senate	so i think he 's good because i like his economic plan i think he 'll do more to help everybody participate in our society and i think he understands the future
but i let me just say something __POSITIVE_FOCUS__	and that 's the record and not rhetoric
but i think we ought to make it without raising taxes by the way without raising payroll taxes which is important	and if we 're able to implement that plan that solves a significant portion of the solvency issue for social security
but if government is powerful enough to block change then it is powerful enough to bring change	it 's going to take a lot of hard work and a lot of cooperation from congress
but if somebody says vote for me i 'd like to go back to the way it was in 1992 and before i would certainly vote against that person	there is nothing to prevent us from saying okay what 's out there that 's a big problem or a big opportunity and let 's go deal with it
but if we are to ride the bronco into the next century we must harness the whole horse not just part of it	it was a magnet a beginning a confidencebuilding measure a way of starting a process that turned out to produce an economic miracle
but if you take the view i take	do you know how many we sent them
but if you want to keep building on the progress your choice is al gore and joe lieberman and the democrats	they 'll keep working for a new cleaner energy policy so we can keep growing the economy and breath the air
but in a socialist society parents should be seen and not heard	beginning of section checked against itn news at ten 10 october 1975
but in addition to my affection for governor dean and my gratitude to the people of vermont for voting for bill clinton and al gore twice by big margins	we had an enormous effort to pass the balanced budget that has things that i think every democrat in this country and every american ought to be proud of
but in any case it is not good enough and if nixon is satisfied with it that is another difference of opinion that we have	now what kind of prosperity is that when the auto industry speeds it up now and then leaves them unsold for the dealers in november
but in fact it laid the foundations for thirteen years of the greatest prosperity this country has known	they 're changes that have been tried in britain back in the 50 's and they worked here
but it 's going to take your involvement people of all ages	so the question is what is the fairest way to change this
but it does not provide similar protection for the rights of victims and that must change	they deserve to be heard at public proceedings regarding the criminal 's sentence or potential release
but it is lightning that does the work	i hope they can hear you in washington
but it is my responsibility to say it and i am going to continue to say it until tuesday and then you have to make a judgment of what you think	what possible indication is there in either the personnel or in the speeches that there is going to be a new movement forward in the united states if nixon is elected
but it is no excuse not to have prevention	this gun show loophole is now a serious problem
but it is this flame that represents the best of the united states of america	and every one of us must summon that spirit of community to meet our challenges
but let me say he will rise up some day and come again	when just a lone african american was serving in the united states congress
but let me tell you nothing we can do will equip our young people for the modern world unless all of our young people have a very good education and are able to keep on learning for a lifetime	what i have tried to do as i have said repeatedly is to build a bridge to this new world and the 21st century so that there is opportunity for every american child responsible enough to work for it
but make no mistake about it we will deliver justice	i want you to know i 'm a patient man
but most of all let 's keep the spiritual and moral strength of america high this is our greatest advantage in this struggle	my wife pat and i have had a very great honor which you the people of this country have made possible for us
but mr chairman the labour government 's botched devolution bill was about as wrong a way to set about putting things right as could be imagined	now i 've already had a word or two about the unity of the kingdom but there is a problem that makes many scots deeply anxious
but now they get to make a living and work and become doctors	the students were complaining that they could get the loans in a hurry
but nowadays there 's no incentive in it no reward ' and then they go on to say for then we see those who do work doing just as well '	here is a golden opportunity to give all the immense skills the glittering craftsmanship the restless commercial genius of a great city like yours the chance it had been waiting for
but on the economic front i think what has been absolutely crucial was the fundamental decision that the president made and that was the call that lynne touched upon that he made with respect that the key to our economic recovery was allowing the american taxpayers to keep more of their own money rather than siphoning it off to washington	and they 're reflected by the changes that we 've all seen over the last few years and then throw it open to questions so we have an opportunity to respond to your concerns and hear from you what you 'd like to talk about try to answer as many of your questions as we can during the time allotted
but our economy remains the strongest in the world thanks to america 's small businesses and to the president 's commitment to tax relief	and we know that as we look around the world and see countries where that 's not the case where women are not empowered
but parliament will i assure you be involved in this process	i have been asked to undertake a tour of community capitals
but regardless we are determined to deny him the capacity to use weapons of mass destruction again	it 's home to of the world 's oil resources and some of its most hostile regimes
but somebody still has to make the investment to put these people to work	he said to her she was the only person capable of running the business
but terror attacks on innocent civilians will not intimidate americans and will not intimidate the iraqi people	as we stand here today many of al qaeda 's known leaders have been captured or killed
but the legislative branch of government as a whole under its current leadership now operates as if it were entirely subservient to the executive branch	the assault has extended to legislative efforts to curtail the jurisdiction of the courts in matters ranging from habeas corpus to the pledge of allegiance
but the reasons can be addressed only if we keep going forward not if we go back	the responsible thing to do is to take your licks and say look for the long run
but the united states under this president will not waver in our commitment	business and civil society leaders have issued reform declarations at aqaba and sanaa
but there 's no single step we could take that would make a bigger difference than resolving the arab israeli conflict	and i want to mention the case of jeffrey swartz who is the head of timberland and who faced this question
but they 'd been in power so long that i did even have the supreme court on my side	and now we 're back to the regular way of doing things if they continue to have their way
but they 've told us that we only have a few minutes to interrupt and i know that you have great entertainment in store for you	there was one i guess almost 200 years ago when our first president was inaugurated and at that time the people came by horseback and stagecoach
but they have to mean everything they say you 've got to take what you said in the primary and what you said in the	and the people took a chance on me because they knew we had to do something and i seemed like i had thought about it
but this concern about a plan not even in effect yet is nothing more than false labor	with bipartisan support we passed the largest spending and tax reductions in the history of this nation
but tough talk in a debate can not obscure a record of being on the wrong side of virtually every national security issue that 's come along	and now in the period since then in 1993 after the first attack on the world trade center he was a member of the senate intelligence committee
but we 're doing a lot better because everybody else has a chance to make the most of their lives as well	i asked the vice president to head that commission to figure out how we could make our airports and our airlines safer
but we are moving in the right direction	what are the results historically low interest rates
but we can do it	and we can do it
but we can give you our full support and my administration will	and i know what your service and sacrifice achieve for our nation
but we can never replace what we might destroy if we do protect those 58 million acres	indeed our entire approach to managing our national forests has been based on striking the right balance
but we can not be successful if we demonstrate the lamentable lack of concern that we have shown for the last eight years	together we are able to ward off any infiltration of alien political and economic ideas that would destroy our freedom and our democracy
but we did not win	that 's what we believe
but we need to make a clear distinction between that which we condemn and that which we welcome	now we know we have to continue to open markets we 're reaching out to places like china
but we thank you for that reason	so that was somewhat of a surprise
but when he told me about this particular incident on our way over to the medal presentation roy said to me said that 's when i got mad	he dropped from the first helicopter that came in before it touched the ground made his way 75 yards under fire to the location of the surrounded patrol
but when that need arises all of us are fortunate to be defended by the united states army air force coast guard navy and marines	some doubt the people of the middle east are capable of yet the desire for freedom is not just american or western it is universal
but who 's keeping score right	i worked for governor warren knowles
but would you like the facts to back it up	but there are many things to talk about this october
but you did not weaken and i kept smiling and hillary kept smiling and the country kept doing better and the people that were doing that just got madder and madder and madder and madder	there is another thing that vic snyder said that i do think we ought to dwell on too much but it bears repeating there 's a difference in the way we do our business too
but you have to believe they 're going to do what they said they would do in the primary as well as the general election	because i do know if this will ever happen again in my lifetime and i 'd like to see america not relax not lay down
by electing roscoe you put a good man in a big job and he has earned another term in the united states congress	in all those years i spent there i think i gained a working knowledge of what makes a really effective member of congress
by helping small businesses we help our entire economy	but they also help the small businesses of america
by the end of next year there should be a democratically elected government in place in iraq	they 've only been in business a few months but iraqis now run all the government ministries
by the time you get to be my age everything reminds you of a story	rookie pitcher tim belcher and reliever alejandro pena led a fine supporting cast of pitchers
can i count on you	our critics call themselves prochoice
can i count on you to help them get reelected and elected	he 's one of the strongest voices in the united states senate
can i count on your help to do that	it will however be allowed the difference in inflation
can i count on your support	the cities that would be destroyed
car control it 's a threat to the constitutional rights of travel	you know in america we have a constitutional right to travel too
chairman abraham lincoln once said no man is good enough to govern another man without that other 's consent	steps of this magnitude towards democracy in poland and hungary would have seemed inconceivable only a short time ago
chairman as you well know i 'm a very patient person	it 's the means by which other goals can be achieved
chairman it 's not advice we require from these people it 's an apology	these people the prophets of the permissive society talk about the quality of life
changing the tax code is a vital and necessary step to making health care affordable for more americans	families with health insurance will pay no income on payroll tax or payroll taxes on of their income
chill out we 're just passing through	and it 's only on loan relax
come august we 'll celebrate our 40th wedding anniversary	that 's the year dwight eisenhower got elected president
come on	thank you
come on up here senator akaka	i thank you for helping him
come to think of it i know some folks who probably look forward to seeing me retire	i 'm glad you are educating the public about the tremendous value of personal savings for retirement
congratulations and may god bless you	we are still in their debt
congratulations and thank you	if you have stop
congratulations on having a beautiful beautiful school	and with secretary of education dick riley
congratulations to him and to you	you have really made a difference
congress is still in session and somebody has to keep an eye on them	so i ask you to cast a vote for your state and for yourselves
congress ought to allow small businesses to join together so they can buy insurance at the same discount that big businesses get to do for the sake of health care for small businesses and their employees	i urge you to take a good look at hsas as a good way to help deal with the rising cost of health care and at the same time make sure your employees have got coverage
congressman i just call her ileana	thank you both for being here
consumers are confident businesses are investing and families are taking home more of what they earn	the bush tax cuts have helped our national economy create jobs now for 10 consecutive months
controlling our vulnerability to racism is every bit as crucial to the future of humankind as controlling the power of the atom	in all these places slight differences have served as an excuse to unleash the evil that lies coiled in the human soul
cut down on the rhetoric turn up the action put people first and move the country forward	i lived and worked in an atmosphere very much like the way you all live and work
deloss dodds i appreciate you doing a fine	i appreciate you coming and your wife kim
democracy is not just about elections even when they seem to go on forever	honduras will offer its children nine years of schooling instead of six a increase
democracy lives and breathes liberty lives and breathes in the heart of every human being	america has honored those who were lost by moving forward with purpose and with valor
democratic candidates have suggested that this could be likened to the soviet invasion of afghanistan	none of the four wars in my lifetime came about because we were too strong
did he put all of the defense plants in hyde park	now they sign them john starkey whoever he is san diego
did you know that einstein actually said he could understand the form 1040	but silly or unproductive tax shelters will be eliminated in our tax reform
disarmament is only one failure of the last 8 years	this is the experience of which so much is heard
do cut people off and walk away from them give them a chance to raise their children and succeed in the workplace	now when this agreement passes it will provide for a balanced budget that has the biggest increase in education in a generation
do give us the about this will all magically work out somehow we want a commitment to oak ridge national laboratory	government laboratories such as the oak ridge national laboratory have played a vital role in catalyzing this nation 's technological development
do leave home without it	now that 's the approach
do let anyone tell you otherwise	interest rates and inflation are low
do mess with illinois	it 's our land
do walk away from it when it is beginning to work	talking about what we 've got to do to get schools
do we increase the size and scope of the federal government	so we set aside money to do so but guess what
do we now have the full force of communism at work and the other one says oh things are going to get a lot worse you know	no dictatorial power will be permitted through the inaction of the united states to arm a clique of its followers and hijack any country in this hemisphere
do you feel better off than you did 4 years ago	we 've negotiated new agreements for grain with the soviet union
do you know that my opponent called what we did a violation of international law that erodes our moral authority to criticize the soviet invasion of afghanistan	what we want is to lower everybody 's income tax rates so your families will be stronger our economy will be stronger and america will be stronger
do you see a target there	san bernardino california several years ago
do you think he 's learned one thing from the terrible mistakes of the past	i know you 're proud of a long excellent tradition in this state georgia football
do you think we should sit back and let that happen to america	all we did was something that every president from washington to lincoln did
do you want to go back to the days of big spending high taxes and runaway inflation	imagine you know i 'm sure that in a crowd like this there have to be some
do you want to go back to the days of inflation and stagnation	it was that long ago they were being told to lower their expectations
do you want to pay for his mistakes	but now he 's pulled back from that
does anyone else anyone here want to go back to the days of inflation taxes and national decline	they can make a turn before the day 's over but it 's pretty solidly growing up there
does that make you just want to be one of his constituents	in the last 18 months new businesses have been incorporated in america
either it 's because i just turned 65	i appreciate the chance to be here today
either you 're for us or you 're against us	americans understand that this is a different type of campaign
encourage the individual and the community benefits	madam president labour 's charge is absurd
erase your initials and initial the erasure	and one little incident you might enjoy
ernie fletcher supported that plan	ernie fletcher has done that

families are taking home more of what they earn	a total of million new jobs during that period
finally the very fact that iraqis are celebrating this day is a testament to the courage the capability and commitment of every single american who has served in iraq	and iraq 's leaders must now make some hard choices necessary to resolve key political questions to advance opportunity and to provide security for their towns and their cities

for the sake of american families for the sake of jobs the congress needs to make tax relief permanent	finally to generate more jobs and to maintain economic growth we need to create certainty in the tax code

happy birthday	thank you
have fun	all right
he 'd already been booed cheered cut sold and traded	his popular books have advanced the cause of science itself
he 'd already done what he should have done and then some a hundred times over but instead he gave another nearly 50 years to public service	and maybe it 's just intrinsically unsuited what we believe to the modern television airline but that 's the modern television age but that 's the truth
he 'll be a great president of the united states	he never gets too old or too proud to learn
he 'll be a strong voice for spending discipline and we need more people like dave mcsweeney in washington	we commend the house of representatives for passing a constitutional veto a critical tool to help protect american taxpayers
he 's a and i 'm not and i think you know that and that 's where i stand	we find that we have had the greatest amount expended for reclamation in this administration of any in history
he 's a good guy	it 's an amazing fact
he 's all standing right in front of him	it must be it 's a guy 's turn

he 's been through a few of these	our extraordinary speaker of the house nancy pelosi
he 's earned the respect of all of us and he 's earned another term in the united states congress	but this line of work takes you in all kinds of interesting directions and today the president is at graceland
he 's interpreting your speech	in fact i was very
he 's ready	carver once said
he 's reunited with his beloved betsy now watching the stories of this century unfold with boundless optimism every so often punctuating the air with a gleeful oh boy	in an era where the news that city hall is on fire can sweep around the world at the speed of the internet would he still have called to
he 's supposed to be pretty good	so you 're used to instant gratification
he 's the basketball player for the utah jazz	omar is the general manager of the montreal expos
he 's the first president in history to do what he has done to guarantee that that gets done because it 's a sin to have all this wealth and not save the children	i 'm talking about having the intelligence to use your wealth to put it somewhere where you get vaccine give it to the right people to give it to the children to save them
he 's the pretty one	and i appreciate her leadership
he asked are you better off today than you were 4 years ago	and we 're going to do something about that this november are we
he can give an answer	that 's the important thing
he did a great job	then they got ahead again
he did a great job for all of us	it 's a pleasure to be in your company
he did only it was just the rich he squeezed it was all of us	you will find that extreme increasingly dominate the labour party and increasingly determine labour policy
he did really say but president 's ca talk like generals	so you young people exercise your sacred right as an american
he dies with a responsible image he dies with a polite image but he dies	and he 's got to pretend he has none just to make it with them
he got an assault weapon ban	because politically it was too tough
he got hold of five ambassadors on the security council and four of them said they 'd never met senator kerry	it 's a book about terrorism but it does obviously sit very well with the problems we 're faced with today

he happened to be the last democrat i voted for	well the american people do want promises i do think

he has improved the prospects for the people of our country	it was projected that year to be 357 billion higher still
he is unafraid and he can look the whole world in the face	he then concluded i ca take the chance that night he slept alone
he meant truman 's administration	what else does he say
he played for the inaugural celebrations of six presidents and nancy and i are happy that last january we happened to come in under the wire as number six	well i think this has been a treat lionel that nancy and i will long remember and i think we 're speaking for everyone here when we say that
he proposed and he delivered tax cuts for the american people not once not twice but four times in four years	our country requires strong and consistent leadership for our actions overseas and the same is true for policies here at home
he proposed and he delivered tax savings to the american people not once not twice but three times	at every level of the ballot events will turn on the outcome of this election of great significance
he said dick if you run for the senate al simpson will kick your fanny	in this world there is information and opinion and then there is knowledge and wisdom
he said especially utility executives get nervous about change	now i have to be honest with you though
he said every man should take unto himself a wife because sooner or later something is bound to happen that you ca blame on the governor	you know having been a governor myself for some time i think i recognize good material when i see it and ted strickland is the best
he said he represented the silent majority which meant i guess the rest of us were in the loud minority	they thought we could actually bring opportunity to people in poor areas there were differences about how to do it
he said i 'll know about it wherever i am and i 'll be happy	we are a federation of sovereign states and we 'd better keep it that way
he said i got a son in the 5th grade and he wants to know what your advice is for him for the future	because for thousands of years people have lived in tribal patterns that taught them to be suspicious of those that were different from themselves
he said i thought i could win but then i realized i did want the damn job	and then during the ' 70s and ' 80s we served together as members of the house

he said in the eighteenth century a state without the means of change is without the means of its conservation '	the commission was given a mandate to produce proposals as to how this could be achieved without infringing basic community principles
he said man will never fly and if he does he wo be from dayton	and on the day they did fly just like today the conditions were not ideal
he said no but everybody else i know is	it 's a huge deal in a country place
he said no i 'm not but he said nearly everybody i know is	anybody that wanted to come up could come up and say whatever they wanted
he said puritanism is the haunting fear that someone somewhere may be happy	let us pledge to conduct ourselves with generosity tolerance and openness toward all
he said that before america acts we must pass a global test	we lost more people that day than we lost at pearl harbor
he says he privately opposed the embargo very privately	his administration did mete out strong punishment after afghanistan
he should be doing his job	in fact he does say anything
he should say the same thing in la crosse as he does in new jersey	the farmers of this country are the best market for detroit and the automobile industry
he slapped some egg on his face and went as a liberal economist	the truth is we 're in the 63d month of this nonstop expansion
he still came anyway	i appreciate charlie coming
he told himself one of these days i 'm going to put my body where my mind is	but on that day our federal government accepted the duty of securing freedom and justice for every american
he was also by the way a good staunch conservative republican	it was illustrated to me by something that happened to me
he was in the center of the line down in michigan stadium	well all of us are in the race for the long haul
he was the last democrat i voted for	now i know that his intentions are good
he was the only major candidate who made the correct judgment about the iraq war	and it 's slowly beginning to sink in to more and more people out there
he was upset when he got to the opening to find a wreath reading rest in peace	an aspect of american history distasteful to some is the important role played by the profit motive
he wo catch us in 70 years provided we continue to move forward as we must in the years ahead	because we 're in a race a race for our survival and we 're challenged by men who are dedicated
he won a scholarship to university and went on to invent a formula that lets computers make billion calculations per second	in the old economy a country 's economic prospects were limited by its place on the map and its natural resources
he would take us back to the day of the sore eagle	the good and decent democrats of the rank and file have changed
hello giants	thank you

his title is minister of bureaucratization	and your record bears me out
his truth is marching on	our god is marching on

how can our people find good jobs	i 'm confident that we 'll recover
how can they say this	we have to work together
how come and the kid said well now their eyes are open	and he was trying to sell them as the people came out
how come and the kid says now they 've got their eyes open	buy a democrat puppy two weeks later the republicans held a fundraiser there
how come kid said now they 've got their eyes open	criminals are going to jail more often and receiving longer sentences
how come they 're republican kittens now kid says because now they 've got their eyes open	but did you hear the story about the kid who was outside the democratic fundraiser selling kittens
how many are being sold	this is an important election
how many people here want to be president of the united states	maybe come to the white house because you 're meeting some goals
how many time has somebody been on you because you took three and a half hours	the american bar association said not that he was qualified but that he was well qualified

how sad to have lost her when i was 15	and of course there was a debate at the time
hundred people	quite tasty
i 'd rather have a judiciary committee headed as it is now by senator strom thurmond than one headed by teddy kennedy any time	and since i began appointing federal judges to be approved by the republican senate the federal judiciary has become tougher much tougher on criminals
i 'd rather have a judiciary committee headed by strom thurmond as it is than one run by joe biden or teddy kennedy	now you realize that the president appoints the federal judges but they ca be a judge unless they are approved by the senate
i 'd rather the bryans be spending that money than the federal government	oh i know for some of the sophisticates they say that 's nothing
i 'll be glad to answer a few questions	community college is a great asset in our country

i 'll tell you there have been moving moments and heartening moments in this campaign but nothing nothing that i 've seen has surpassed seeing the young people of our country give us their support	all right if anyone doubts the great renewal in this country let them look at the bright and shining optimism of our young people our high school students college students and our young working people
i 'll tell you what one of clinton 's unbending laws of politics is whenever somebody who 's got a tough decision to make can shift the heat from the themselves to you they 'll do it every time	there can be a lot of good things in it but under our plan every year every person would have a choice between at least three plans or among at least three plans but in all probability many more
i 'm a lighthouse __IRONICAL_FOCUS__	and an admiral in command
i 'm ashamed of the people who were so sinful to make me a slave yes sir yes	psychological freedom a firm sense of is the most powerful weapon against the long night of physical slavery

i 'm delighted to see all of the young people	tom manger the chief of the montgomery county police department

i 'm fortunate to the be president of the greatest land on the face of the earth	i think about homeless shelters staffed by volunteers who feel the need to help somebody in need
i 'm getting kind of wound up here yeah	there will be institutions greater than the people there
i 'm glad you 're here	and the future depends upon that
i 'm going to do my part after time magazine i 'm going to wear my pinstriped suit to geneva	i ca leave without reminding you that america must remain freedom 's staunchest friend for freedom is our staunchest ally

i ask you to help us move this country forward	this is not merely a contest between nixon and myself
i ask you to join me in making this the greatest country on earth the strongest country	the other day herter said that ghana had joined the communist side and the congo is uncertain
i believe for these reasons that liberalism is our best and our only hope in the world today	i do not favor state compulsion when voluntary individual effort can do the job and do it well
i believe it should be to save social security and medicare and in so doing	so i 'd like to talk to you tonight about three aspects of our challenge
i believe that	example number one
i believe that and if you do we 've got a great future	we believe in preventing crime and punishing criminals not explaining away their behavior

i bet you were wondering when i would get to a story	a month later from the same platform daniel ortega replied to me

i ca believe it was so long ago	i want to compliment your whole democratic team
i ca help but believe that he who has so blessed this land and made us a good and caring people should never have been expelled from our classrooms	we 're urging corporations community organizations and neighborhood groups across the country to adopt schools and help them meet their educational and vocational needs with funds equipment and personnel
i call it getting wet all over	and let us encourage achievement and excellence
i call on congress to quickly send me legislation that makes cockpits more secure baggage screening more thorough and puts the federal government in charge of all airport screening and security	i recently spoke to high school students in maryland and realized that for the first time ever these seniors will graduate in the midst of a war in our own country

i think that 's a very good sign	it is a picture of america 's future
i think that 's the right thing to do	all of this has to be done in partnership
i think that 's very very important	we thought that was a false choice
i think that is the right thing to do	now why do we go ahead and do this
i think that is very important	i think it is terribly important
i think the american people can be confident of a better future a stronger economy and greater security against the dangers of this new era because of the character and the leadership of president george bush	five days from today the 20th of january marks the third anniversary of the day that george bush and i were sworn in as the 43rd president and the 46th vice president of the united states
i think the best way to give the impression to khrushchev that everything is right in this country is to make everything right	they may not go to bed hungry every night but they do go to bed very well fed and here is my source

i think we might even beat you in michigan	i do think there is a disagreement on that
i think we must demonstrate sufficient vigor sufficient friendship for them that they will follow the road that we follow the road of peace	the great test will be which system travels better which system solves the problems of the people of latin america and africa and asia
i think we ought to all go along for the ride	your little gene map is going to be out there somewhere
i think we ought to give people the same tax incentives to invest in poor areas in america we give them to invest in poor areas around the world	and you should know that there 's a big difference in the parties on these two things what to do for the seniors what to do for the children
i think you can do it	that was a decision i made
i think you ought to support it	there are states that have done it
i thought at the time i should have quit speaking right there i could top that	and it 's possible that similar discriminatory statutes and regulations may exist today in other states

if people are going to be working for smaller companies not bigger ones and moving around at least they ought to know they can take some time off without losing a job if there 's someone sick in their family or if a baby is born or some other emergency arises	for example we do have the figures yet on '94 but i think '94 will confirm '93 's trend in 1993 we had the largest number of new businesses started in america in any year in history and the largest number of new millionaires in america in any year in history
if republican leaders send me a bill that make workers wait for another year for their full pay raise and holds the minimum wage hostage for risky tax cuts that threaten our prosperity i 'll veto it	this is the right thing to do for working families the right thing to do for our economy at a time when we 've got labor shortages that will draw more people back into the labor market

if we 're going to have a tax cut let 's finance more people going on to school	i believe in the americorps program the national service program which enables people to earn money for college
if we can just figure out how to produce it at an affordable price we 'll be in great shape	we have been cutting defense since 1987 but we did not seriously begin to invest in defense conversion until 1993
if we do that we 're going to do the right things and we 'll get a better country out of it	and if you talk to any group of working people today you find that that 's what they 're often worried about

if we do we 'll have more people like darlene in congress	that 's what i 've asked people to join me in doing

if we were still the people that we ought to we were still the people that we ought to tree of liberty would have been watered with our blood several times in the last several decades as we stood up to reject the lies that have been promulgated as law in these united states	but i have found over the course of the last few years that singing them just is what it used to be ' cause part of me is singing the words and part of me is thinking about the fact that the reality of this nation 's life no longer corresponds to those words

if you 're a parent visit your child 's school	in return we expect that parents will use this information
if you 're a senator you can work until you know	so it 's not that social security would go away jay

if you take care of ordinary people it works	we beat off all their efforts to weaken unions
if you want welfare reform that 's it	and that is what we are doing today
im am greatful that they responded positively to that appeal	that must be the main instrument for creating new jobs

thanks to you i was able to deliver wyoming twice to the ticket	i may help in 2008 if i 'm asked in terms of campaigning
that 's a big mistake for us not to do that	it means we have to do our part with global warming
that 's a convenient time for me to retire	in other words the system is solvent for you
that 's a drag brothers	it attaches you to nothing
that 's a good one	but barbara is always there
that 's a good sign	so reckless practices were rampant
that 's a lot better than unemployment benefits	they say this bill adds to the deficit
that 's a part of your legacy and you should be proud of it	they said well president clinton and vice president gore are going to get reelected
that 's a smart thing to do if you have a restaurant	one of the entrepreneurs a fellow named ernest henley he 's here
that 's a source of annoyance to a number of people	well when i got my diploma unemployment was around 25 percent

that 's all	i say this
that 's all right	this holiday embodies that
that 's all that matters	he never knew his father

that 's great	senator graham bryan
that 's his valentine present to you	and the default rate has dropped by
that 's how federal express got started intel and a lot of other places	how can we preserve our environment and grow our economy and be more efficient
that 's how this system works	now that 's how this works
that 's important	and life imprisonment
that 's just not true	that 's the second point
that 's more than 150 a month	unfortunately they did punish the soviet union
that 's more than double the rate of decline	we 've made progress in early detection and screening
that 's not going to happen because we 're going to win this election	and there would be if we had more reasonable judges on the federal bench
that 's not going to happen on our watch	and the attack on the uss cole in 2000
that 's one of the reasons why we wanted to come here because we wanted to model	it 's just more people coming on and making let 's move a broader and stronger campaign
that 's pretty good for america	i know the hour is late
that 's real money even in rhode island	social security is not causing the federal deficit
that 's really what this is about	this is not about balancing the budget
that 's right	that 's all
that 's something i proposed you know in the last year i was president	but you have to be willing to fight for real solutions to real problems
that 's the american understanding	and what is the dogma
that 's the difference	it was absolutely wonderful
that 's the gore plan	here 's the democratic program
that 's the kind of attitude we need in this country people taking responsibilities for themselves their employees and their future	i feel guilty that i do insure my employees and i 'm mad that none of my competitors insure their employees
that 's the kind of governor matt blunt will be for the people of missouri	but in fact the bush tax cuts are what brought us out of the recession
that 's the only reason she did it	she was from a tiny town in oaxaca
that 's the true strength of this country	that 's the great strength of this country
that 's the way they do it	that 's what you need to do
that 's the way to persuade people to put their efforts and their money in scotland	so let us take stock for a minute of what has already been achieved in scotland
that 's the worst thing we could do	this nation is moving in the right direction
that 's the wrong choice wrong direction wrong leadership for america	and at that convention in new york last week guess what
that 's what happened here and that 's what we have to do everywhere else in america	this is a action of the federal government the way we 've changed the community reinvestment act
that 's what he said	we want banks to thrive
that 's what i 've come to tell you	and also we 've put out small business loans
that 's what i believe	now why is ours better
that 's what i believe ought to happen	it 's a novel idea for social security
that 's what i came here today	let me tell you what plagues me
that 's what i think	the education initiatives are stronger
that 's what i tried to do	more americans are losing their health insurance
that 's what i want you to do	but nudge your buddy that friend you know
that 's what i was in	we thought things would be just
that 's what it 's about	we knew we had to change
that 's what kids do they break stuff	health care reform is part of that movement
that 's what leaving no one behind really means when you put your life on the line	when i campaigned for john kerry 's senate seat in 1996 he was resolved in his convictions
that 's what that choice is all about on november 2nd	they say that americans are taking 90 percent of the casualties
that 's what the role of government ought to be	and that 's one of the principles of this debate
that 's what their program is	we will deny that it happened
that 's what they were hired to do and you 'll stick with them if they can do it	and it means we have to act at long last to bring health care costs in line with inflation
that 's what this is about	they said no to rebuilding infrastructure
that 's what this is all about	why do i believe this will work
that 's what we 're about	if people decided to step up
that 's what we 're for	now why do they do it
that 's what we 've got to do	but you can make fuel out of anything
that 's what we believe	beats anything i ever saw
that 's what we fight for	there 's money on all sides
that 's what we have to do	i was raised being told about this
that 's what we need for you to do today	they let the students pick the uniforms and design them
that 's what we ought to be doing	it 's a privilege to do extracurricular activities
that 's what we think	it will affect economic policy
that 's what were going to do when the next administration comes in	because 18 to 22 there is a lot of transition in those years
that 's what you tell them	from setting high expectations for yourselves
that 's why a third of my cabinet has already visited india not only for the chapatis	and it just was a wonderful reminder of how strong the bonds between our two countries are
that 's why he did it	his own faithful shadow al gore
that 's why i 'm going back to northern ireland next week the land of my ancestors	they 'll open their doors to more foreign investment and more foreign information and the internet revolution
that 's why i believe in andre carson and joe donnelly and brad ellsworth and baron hill	that 's why i 'm here because i ca bring the change i promised all by myself
that 's why i have proposed time limits and work requirements but also child care and health care to help people move from welfare to work	we also know that where are children are concerned the most important of america 's building blocks is not a strong government but a strong family
that 's why i was proud to sign the edward kennedy serve america act expanding americorps and senior corps other programs that give people the chance to give back	the courage the patriotism the compassion that drove them to act are the same qualities we need today as we seek to answer the questions of our own time
that 's why the second part of let 's move is to get healthier food into our schools	and we 're working with doctors and pediatricians to ensure that they routinely screen our children for obesity
that 's why the vice president 's report on reinventing government is so important	we have to look more to a lot of other problems in our economy
that 's why we 're making a major investment in research to identify the best treatments for a variety of ailments and conditions	the second structural reform we need to make is to improve the quality of medical information making its way to doctors and patients
that 's why we worked so hard to enforce the community reinvestment act and then to save it in this last banking legislation because 95 percent of all the lending every made under that law has happened since this administration has been in office	and so i say to you the greatest honor i could have is to know that you will work with me for the next odd days and that you will continue to work to make sure that we do not blow this precious moment
that 's why with the support of sherrod brown but also members of the house of representatives mary jo kilroy steve driehaus and charlie wilson who are all here wave guys	my last visit here was a little over a year ago when i came to take part in a graduation ceremony for 114 the 114th class of the columbus police recruits
that 's wrong and this administration is going to get it right	a full of them have been pending for more than a year
that a head without a heart is not humanity	demonstrating there is no war to end all war
that appeared in time magazine in june of 1933	it has allowed us to adapt and to thrive
that can achieved	i understand that
that cancellation	thank you
that certain moments call on us to stop the back and forth and the bickering to forget the old rivalries and embrace a common purpose that is bigger than our differences	but then when one operative expressed his concern to president clinton the president sharply rebuked him replying this is much more important than politics this is much more important than politics
that fool we got in there now is no damn good	i wanted to make sure i personally greeted every voter there
that group that is elected then will write a constitution and by the end of next year they 'll have new elections under an constitution and you 'll have a democratically elected government in place in iraq	very tough customer ayad allawi he 's willing to go back to iraq and knows he 's the target of the terrorists and the former regime elements who 'd like nothing better than to do him in
that he 's liberal liberal liberal	yes the liberals were in 1980
that if you do the same job as a man you should make the same wage as a man	and claire and i together every day are fighting for an economy in which americans can compete and win
that if you want war we shall make more effective war	because going to that dance sadly does depend on you alone
that industry was producing only 2 percent of the world 's advanced batteries last year but by 2015 we expect to produce 40 percent of the advanced batteries that go into our cars	it was more successful than we ever imagined and it saved at least jobs giving dealerships sales numbers they had had in years and communities an economic boost they would have otherwise seen

that is a miracle	take up the gangplank
that is a priceless gift	for the idea of america
that is a remarkable commitment	that will be the test
that is a tribute to the professionalism we see every day from our military forces all around the world	what else would they have accomplished for their families and their country if only they had had the chance

that is almost triple its current funding	we want microenterprise to take root everywhere
that is in the education the skills the reasoning capacity and the creativity of our own people	and most important of all information has become global and has become king of the global economy
that is my dream and that 's the present i want for you	so my gift to you is to remember that this is a choice
that is my message to you	people sometimes come to me concerned
that is not true	america won this battle
that is not who we are	but how do they defeat us
that is one trillion additional reasons you can feel comfortable supporting this budget	we should also prepare for the unexpected for the uncertainties of the future
that is our goal	we run as democrats
that is our next great test and i think we 're off to a good beginning today	as i said we 're now extending unemployment benefits and that 's a good thing to do
that is our objective and this is our policy	this election may be decided here in your state
that is part of our obligation to give people a chance to make the most of their abilities by creating economic opportunity	it should be smaller and less bureaucratic and less cumbersome and burdensome and more efficient and more flexible for the information age
that is something we 've got to work on together	that 's part of my responsibility as and as president
that is the balance that we must seek to achieve	but we recognize that there are other responsibilities as well
that is the good news and that is good news	the jobs we were creating were overwhelmingly lower paying jobs
that is the idea and the critical thing is the interest rates	if you think about it mortgage rates currently are at about percent
that is the message america needs to heed today	that 's why we wanted to come here today
that is the path that will bring burma true security and prosperity	these are not impediments to stability they are the cornerstones of stability
that is the role of the national government	on this issue we must all stand firm
that is the second choice	so here 's your choice
that is the secret of america 's progress	and you know where it is my friends
that is the thread	they 're educating girls
that is the way that our citizens and our electors are going to be able to gain benefit from europe and i strongly support what she has said	these are indeed grave days that we live in madam president the situation just evolving at the moment in poland is giving us all grave cause for anxiety
that is the work that i have come to europe to begin	as the world has become less divided it has become more interconnected
that is what happens	our founders were right
that is what i came here to say	to experience the joy of another morning sunrise
that is what is special about america	then others did things that were foolish
that is what the 1996 elections are all about	i am telling you this is a great country
that is what we are doing	i say what is the issue
that is what we want in this country	fifteen million american families live in inadequate housing
that is what you have proved here	i remember some stories of courage too
that makes the whole thing mutual because america sees two john kerrys	his reflects a habit of indecision and sends a message of confusion
that means don beyer should be governor of virginia	and now we are looking to facing to future
that must be our shared objective	we have got to do more
that must come from the moral conscience of our humanity	it does tell you whether they 're good or bad
that should be a controversial or complicated matter	there 's no excuse for not doing it
that war goes on and thanks in part to all of you it 's a war we are going to win	to stand here at offutt air force base is to be reminded of how the world changed on that terrible morning
that was so far out even ted kennedy would support it	and i think you have to go look at the record
that way when somebody goes through a training program they know that there 's a job at the end of that training	we 'll put colleges and employers together to create programs that match curricula in the classroom with the needs of the boardroom
that we must restore the moral basis of our own and moral because without it we will surrender all our liberties	so we 're going to take your liberty after we 've undermined your character they know what they 're up to
that we ought to trust the people of this country	and that 's a part of the bill as well
that we will lead the world in math and science achievement not bring up the rear	most of you may not know what they are but i think they 're good goals
that whole story is here in 80 million documents 21 million two of them mine	and let me lastly thank the people who have contributed to and built this library
that will affect over 40 million americans who are either the workers the spouses or the children of the families who will get tax relief under this economic plan in april	raised taxes on fewer than two percent of the american people earning the largest amounts of money whose taxes had been lowered while their incomes went up in the ' 80s
that will be a great achievement indeed primarily a success in terms of social policy	it was certainly also a signal for an acceleration of developments within the european community
that will be decisive	this is built where

the conflict can only end with their complete and permanent destruction	after september 11 there was no question about going to war

the current enforcement system relies too much on public relations documentation and not enough on real lending performance	it is our job to empower those communities with the tools they need to generate growth and jobs
the current tax code of the united states should be bagged shredded and hauled to the nearest dump	she lives here we all live here whenever we can in the summer and in the vacation periods
the day of trying to frighten seniors in america to be against something is over with	we provide money in the budget to help the working uninsured be able to purchase insurance

the evidence does not faze them	and you 've got to decide
the federal government 's job is not to manage or control the economy but to remove obstacles standing in the way of faster growth	not surprisingly the american people are using their money far better than government would have and congress was right to let them keep it
the federal government should do the same	but we took office amid a crisis
the federal surplus is the people 's money	we establish a contingency fund for future needs
the firefighters of the united states of america	they put themselves on the line every day
the first budget surpluses in 42 years	the lowest unemployment rate in 29 years
the first was the capture of saddam hussein by our troops in iraq which provides final confirmation	it was three years ago next tuesday that president bush and i took up our own responsibilities
the football team will get even better	and she makes it fun you know
the free exercise of religion means that we have the right in our families and in our schools and in our communities and in our governments and in our states to live according to the word of god	but we need to continue though congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise now i want to stop there because you know i 'm now and i gotta tell you

the gas gauge reads full and then it was rochester his sidekick there on the show who answered and says well it 's painted that way	well you know we can tell our children and grandchildren that there was a time when taxes were lower and simpler and it does stop there
the general also wisely notes that when you are fighting a global war you have to be able to wage it on many fronts at once as the united states has	but general tommy franks who was in charge of american forces in the middle east has stated repeatedly it was not at all certain that bin laden was in tora bora
the good news in the state of maine is the governor agrees	one size does not fit all when it comes to educating children

the international community together with nations in africa must bear its share of responsibility for this tragedy as well	all of this was done clearly to make it easy for otherwise reluctant people to participate in wholesale slaughter
the judicial confirmation is broken and it must be fixed for the good of the country	today we are facing a crisis in the senate and therefore a crisis in our judiciary
the last labour government in which healey was chancellor and the sdp were prominent members and which latterly the liberals kept in office that was the government which had to be rescued by the international community from the folly of the very policies which labour would now like to try again	very different countries but all badly hit by the world recession all with one economic purpose all resolved and to quote the words of our declaration to promote a sound and sustainable recovery bringing new jobs and a better life for the people of our own countries and of the world
the last thing i want to say is i 'm highly prejudiced about this senate race	and every one of you have friends who will never come to an event like this
the latest to announce they are beginning to withdraw from the coalition are poland and italy	and of course as everyone knows here to every one of these impressions was completely wrong
the law matters	first the law
the liberals are singing the same song now they sang then and it sure is do worry be happy	make a false move and the next sound you hear is the clang of a jail cell slamming shut
the liberty to choose his way	that 's what depends on us
the longer labour remains in government the more vulnerable this country will be	we in the conservative party are determined that britain should fulfil that role
the longest peacetime expansion in history	these are just basic simple things
the main thing tonight though is we expect you to have a good time	so i want to congratulate you for having worked through a very difficult year
the marshal had caught up with the parade just in time to turn the whole band to the right down an intersection where they were supposed to go and i was going up the street all by myself	you know i used to be a democrat myself until i learned that the liberal leadership of that party had become completely out of step with the and patriotic men and women who make up the democratic party

the notion that in some essential way each of us in our humanity has a claim to dignity a claim to be respected in our human life and worth that is the equal of every other human claim	and we have a fellow telling us i found most telling in this article by the way was this line about how so how do you provide grounds for outlawing neonaticide how do you provide grounds for it
the notion that we can turn our backs on what happens in places like afghanistan iraq or any other possible safe haven for terrorists is an option that we can never again indulge after 9 11	we 'll win this war by staying on the offensive carrying the fight to the enemy going after them one by one if necessary going after those who could equip them with even more dangerous technologies
the objective is to finish the mission to get the job done to do it right	now the challenge for us going forward here is to make certain we get it right
the only option against these enemies is to find them to fight them and to defeat them	in the weeks ahead americans deserve and judge roberts deserves a process that is honest and bipartisan
the only problem is that he endorsed the idea just 17 days earlier	it will reduce the stress on our troops and on our military families
the only way we can lose in iraq is if we lose our nerve and i am not going to lose my nerve	our goal in iraq is to have an ally in the war on terror and to help that young country establish an democracy

the president and i will not be satisfied until every american who wants to work can find a job	every american who pays federal income taxes has benefited from the bush tax cuts and so has the economy
the president and i will stand with america 's workers	mortgage rates and interest rates and inflation are all low
the president believes that government should try to help people improve their lives not try to run them	helping families face the challenges of our changing world is at the heart of the president 's plan
the president has made clear	that is not the case
the president has signed into law three separate tax relief measures resulting in significant tax relief for millions of american families and businesses	whatever the explanation it is not an impressive record for someone who aspires to become in this time of testing for our country
the president is absolutely determined to do that	and that 's what it 's all about
the president of the united states is the under article ii of our constitution and that 's as it should be	whether or not he 's the man to take over that responsibility and i 'm not challenging his patriotism never have
