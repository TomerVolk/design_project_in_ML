"Vegetarianism is the practice of abstaining from the consumption of meat (red meat, poultry, seafood, and the flesh of any other animal), and may also include abstention from by-products of animal slaughter"
Vegetarianism may be adopted for various reasons
 Many people object to eating meat out of respect for sentient life
" Such ethical motivations have been codified under various religious beliefs, as well as animal rights advocacy"
" Other motivations for vegetarianism are health-related, political, environmental, cultural, aesthetic, economic, or personal preference"
" There are variations of the diet as well: an ovo-lacto vegetarian diet includes both eggs and dairy products, an ovo-vegetarian diet includes eggs but not dairy products, and a lacto-vegetarian diet includes dairy products but not eggs"
" A vegan diet excludes all animal products, including eggs and dairy"
" Avoidance of animal products may require dietary supplements to prevent deficiencies such as vitamin B12 deficiency, which leads to pernicious anemia"
" Psychologically, preference for vegetarian foods can be affected by one's own socio-economic status and evolutionary factors"
"Packaged and processed foods, such as cakes, cookies, candies, chocolate, yogurt, and marshmallows, often contain unfamiliar animal ingredients, and so may be a special concern for vegetarians due to the likelihood of such additives"
 Feelings among vegetarians vary concerning these ingredients
" Some vegetarians scrutinize product labels for animal-derived ingredients, such as cheese made with rennet, while other vegetarians do not object to consuming them or are unaware of their presence"
"Semi-vegetarian diets consist largely of vegetarian foods but may include fish or poultry, or sometimes other meats, on an infrequent basis"
 Those with diets containing fish or poultry may define meat only as mammalian flesh and may identify with vegetarianism
" A pescetarian diet has been described as ""fish but no other meat"""
"The first written use of the term ""vegetarian"" originated in the early 19th century, when authors referred to a vegetable regimen diet"
 Modern dictionaries explain its origin as a compound of vegetable (adjective) and the suffix -arian (in the sense of agrarian)
" The term was popularized with the foundation of the Vegetarian Society in Manchester in 1847, although it may have appeared in print before 1847"
" The earliest occurrences of the term seem to be related to Alcott House—a school on the north side of Ham Common, London—which was opened in July 1838 by James Pierrepont Greaves"
" From 1841, it was known as A Concordium, or Industry Harmony College, from which time the institution began to publish its own pamphlet entitled The Healthian, which provides some of the earliest appearances of the term ""vegetarian"""
India is a strange country
" People do not killany living creatures, do not keep pigs and fowl,and do not sell live cattle"
"—Faxian, 4th/5th century CEChinese pilgrim to India"
"The earliest record of vegetarianism comes from the 7th century BCE, inculcating tolerance towards all living beings"
" Parshwanatha and Mahavira, the 23rd & 24th tirthankaras in Jainism respectively revived and advocated ahimsa and Jain vegetarianism in 8th to 6th century BC; the most comprehensive and strictest form of vegetarianism"
" In Indian culture, vegetarianism has been closely connected with the attitude of nonviolence towards animals (called ahimsa in India) for millennia and was promoted by religious groups and philosophers"
 The ancient Indian work of Tirukkural explicitly and unambiguously emphasizes shunning meat and non-killing
" Chapter 26 of the Tirukkural, particularly couplets 251–260, deals exclusively on vegetarianism or veganism"
"Among the Hellenes, Egyptians, and others, vegetarianism had medical or ritual purification purposes"
 Vegetarianism was also practiced in ancient Greece and the earliest reliable evidence for vegetarian theory and practice in Greece dates from the 6th century BC
" The Orphics, a religious movement spreading in Greece at that time, also practiced and promoted vegetarianism"
" Greek teacher Pythagoras, who promoted the altruistic doctrine of metempsychosis, may have practiced vegetarianism, but is also recorded as eating meat"
" A fictionalized portrayal of Pythagoras appears in Ovid's Metamorphoses, in which he advocates a form of strict vegetarianism"
" It was through this portrayal that Pythagoras was best known to English-speakers throughout the early modern period and, prior to the coinage of the word ""vegetarianism"", vegetarians were referred to in English as ""Pythagoreans"""
" Vegetarianism was also practiced about six centuries later in another instance (30 BCE–50 CE) in the northern Thracian region by the Moesi tribe (who inhabited present-day Serbia and Bulgaria), feeding themselves on honey, milk, and cheese"
"In Japan in 675, the Emperor Tenmu prohibited the killing and the eating of meat during the busy farming period between April and September but excluded the eating of wild birds and animals"
 These bans and several others that followed over the centuries were overturned in the nineteenth century during the Meiji Restoration
" In China, during the Song Dynasty, Buddhist cuisine became popular enough that vegetarian restaurants appeared where chefs used ingredients such as beans, gluten, root vegetables and mushrooms to create meat analogues including pork, fowl, eggs and crab roe"
"Following the Christianization of the Roman Empire in late antiquity, vegetarianism practically disappeared from Europe, as it did elsewhere, except in India"
" Several orders of monks in medieval Europe restricted or banned the consumption of meat for ascetic reasons, but none of them eschewed fish"
" Moreover, the medieval definition of ""fish"" included such animals as seals, porpoises, dolphins, barnacle geese, puffins, and beavers"
" Vegetarianism re-emerged during the Renaissance, becoming more widespread in the 19th and 20th centuries"
" In 1847, the first Vegetarian Society was founded in the United Kingdom; Germany, the Netherlands, and other countries followed"
" In 1886, the vegetarian colony Nueva Germania was founded in Paraguay, though its vegetarian aspect would prove short-lived"
":345–358 The International Vegetarian Union, an association of the national societies, was founded in 1908"
" In the Western world, the popularity of vegetarianism grew during the 20th century as a result of nutritional, ethical, and—more recently—environmental and economic concerns"
There are a number of vegetarian diets that exclude or include various foods:
"Within the ""ovo-"" groups, there are many who refuse to consume fertilized eggs (with balut being an extreme example); however, such distinction is typically not specifically addressed"
Some vegetarians also avoid products that may use animal ingredients not included in their labels or which use animal products in their manufacturing
" For example, sugars that are whitened with bone char, cheeses that use animal rennet (enzymes from animal stomach lining), gelatin (derived from the collagen inside animals' skin, bones, and connective tissue), some cane sugar (but not beet sugar) and beverages (such as apple juice and alcohol) clarified with gelatin or crushed shellfish and sturgeon, while other vegetarians are unaware of, or do not mind, such ingredients"
" In the 21st century, 90% of rennet and chymosin used in cheesemaking are derived from industrial fermentation processes, which satisfy both kosher and halal requirements"
"Individuals sometimes label themselves ""vegetarian"" while practicing a semi-vegetarian diet, as some dictionary definitions describe vegetarianism as sometimes including the consumption of fish, or only include mammalian flesh as part of their definition of meat, while other definitions exclude fish and all animal flesh"
" In other cases, individuals may describe themselves as ""flexitarian"""
"These diets may be followed by those who reduce animal flesh consumed as a way of transitioning to a complete vegetarian diet or for health, ethical, environmental, or other reasons"
 Semi-vegetarian diets include:
"Semi-vegetarianism is contested by vegetarian groups, such as the Vegetarian Society, which states that vegetarianism excludes all animal flesh"
"Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2010 – A report issued by the U"
 Department of Agriculture and the U
 Department of Health and Human Services
"In western countries, the most common motive for people to consider turning vegetarian has to do with health consciousness"
 Studies on the health effects of vegetarian diets observe mixed effects on mortality
" One review found a decreased overall risk of all cause mortality, cancer (except breast) and cardiovascular disease; however, a meta-analysis found lower risk for ischemic heart disease and cancer but no effect on overall mortality or cerebrovascular disease"
" Possible limitations include varying definitions used of vegetarianism, and the observation of increased risk of lung cancer mortality in those on a vegetarian diet for less than five years"
 An analysis pooling two large studies found vegetarians in the UK have similar all cause mortality as meat eaters
"The American Dietetic Association has stated that at all stages of life, a properly planned vegetarian diet can be ""healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may be beneficial in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases"
""" By adequately planned, they meant eating a variety of foods (especially fruits and vegetables), and minimizing foods high in sodium, sweeteners, or fat"
" Vegetarian diets offer lower levels of saturated fat, cholesterol and animal protein, and higher levels of carbohydrates, fibre, magnesium, potassium, folate, and antioxidants such as vitamins C and E and phytochemicals"
"Studies have shown that a vegetarian diet may increase the risk of vitamin B 12 deficiency, calcium deficiency and low bone mineral density"
A 2019 review found that vegetarians have lower bone mineral density at the femoral neck and lumbar spine compared to omnivores
"A 2020 meta-analysis found that a vegetarian lifestyle may contribute to bone loss, low height and low weight"
" However, the same meta-analysis found that infants with a precise vegetarian diet containing milk and dairy products exhibit normal growth and development"
"A 2019 review found that a vegetarian diet may be associated with greater risk of dental erosion because vegetarians ""tend to eat more fruits and vegetables than people following a nonvegetarian diet"" and therefore ""consumption of these acidic foods may lower the pH level in the oral cavity, which in turn may be related to the development of caries"
""" The review, however, stated that its findings ""should be interpreted with caution"" because of the ""limited comparability of the studies as well as limited (to no) correction for confounding in the studies"
""" It characterized this as ""a major flaw"" of the research"
Vegetarian diets might reduce the risk of developing diabetes
 There is evidence that a vegetarian diet may help people with type 2 diabetes achieve glycemic control
"A 2015 review found that vegetarian diets ""effectively lower blood concentrations of total cholesterol, low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol, high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol, and non–high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol"
"A 2020 review of vegan and vegetarian diets showed association with a higher risk of depression and anxiety, particularly among people under 26 years old"
" However, a different review published in the same year found no significant associations between a vegetarian diet and depression or anxiety"
"The American Dietetic Association discussed that vegetarian diets may be more common among adolescents with eating disorders indicating that vegetarian diets do not cause eating disorders, but rather ""vegetarian diets may be selected to camouflage an existing eating disorder"""
"A 1999 meta-analysis combined data from five studies from western countries, finding that mortality ratios – where lower numbers indicated fewer deaths – were 1"
"0 for regular meat eaters as a base mortality rate, 0"
"82 for fish eaters, and 0"
84 for vegetarians
" The study concluded that """
"vegetarians had a 24% lower mortality from ischemic heart disease than non-vegetarians"", results similar to those of a 2017 review"
There is no good evidence that vegetarian diets reduce the risk or symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis
"Western vegetarian diets are typically high in carotenoids, but relatively low in omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin B12"
" Vegans can have particularly low intake of vitamin B and calcium if they do not eat enough items such as collard greens, leafy greens, tempeh and tofu (soy)"
" High levels of dietary fiber, folic acid, vitamins C and E, and magnesium, and low consumption of saturated fat are all considered to be beneficial aspects of a vegetarian diet"
 A well planned vegetarian diet will provide all nutrients in a meat-eater's diet to the same level for all stages of life
Protein intake in vegetarian diets tends to be lower than in meat diets but can meet the daily requirements for most people
" Studies at Harvard University as well as other studies conducted in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and various European countries,confirmed vegetarian diets provide sufficient protein intake as long as a variety of plant sources are available and consumed"
"Vegetarian diets typically contain similar levels of iron to non-vegetarian diets, but this has lower bioavailability than iron from meat sources, and its absorption can sometimes be inhibited by other dietary constituents"
" According to the Vegetarian Resource Group, consuming food that contains vitamin C, such as citrus fruit or juices, tomatoes, or broccoli, is a good way to increase the amount of iron absorbed at a meal"
" Vegetarian foods rich in iron include black beans, cashews, hempseed, kidney beans, broccoli, lentils, oatmeal, raisins, spinach, cabbage, lettuce, black-eyed peas, soybeans, many breakfast cereals, sunflower seeds, chickpeas, tomato juice, tempeh, molasses, thyme, and whole-wheat bread"
" The related vegan diets can often be higher in iron than vegetarian diets, because dairy products are low in iron"
" Iron stores often tend to be lower in vegetarians than non-vegetarians, and a few small studies report very high rates of iron deficiency (up to 40%, and 58% of the respective vegetarian or vegan groups)"
" However, the American Dietetic Association states that iron deficiency is no more common in vegetarians than non-vegetarians (adult males are rarely iron deficient); iron deficiency anaemia is rare no matter the diet"
Vitamin B12 is not generally present in plants but is naturally found in foods of animal origin
" Lacto-ovo vegetarians can obtain B12 from dairy products and eggs, and vegans can obtain it from manufactured fortified foods (including plant-based products and breakfast cereals) and dietary supplements"
" A strict vegetarian diet avoiding consumption of all animal products risks vitamin B12 deficiency, which can lead to hyperhomocysteinemia, a risk factor for several health disorders, including anemia, neurological deficits, gastrointestinal problems, platelet disorders, and increased risk for cardiovascular diseases"
 The recommended daily dietary intake of B12 in the United States and Canada is 0
"4 mcg (ages 0–6 months), rising to 1"
"8 mcg (9–13 years), 2"
"4 mcg (14+ years), and 2"
8 mcg (lactating female)
" While the body's daily requirement for vitamin B12 is in microgram amounts, deficiency of the vitamin through strict practice of a vegetarian diet without supplementation can increase the risk of several chronic diseases"
"Plant-based, or vegetarian, sources of Omega 3 fatty acids include soy, walnuts, pumpkin seeds, canola oil, kiwifruit, hempseed, algae, chia seed, flaxseed, echium seed and leafy vegetables such as lettuce, spinach, cabbage and purslane"
 Purslane contains more Omega 3 than any other known leafy green
 Olives (and olive oil) are another important plant source of unsaturated fatty acids
 Plant foods can provide alpha-linolenic acid which the human body uses to synthesize the long-chain n-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA
 EPA and DHA can be obtained directly in high amounts from oily fish or fish oils
" Vegetarians, and particularly vegans, have lower levels of EPA and DHA than meat-eaters"
" While the health effects of low levels of EPA and DHA are unknown, it is unlikely that supplementation with alpha-linolenic acid will significantly increase levels"
"[clarification needed] Recently, some companies have begun to market vegetarian DHA supplements containing seaweed extracts"
 Whole seaweeds are not suitable for supplementation because their high iodine content limits the amount that may be safely consumed
" However, certain algae such as spirulina are good sources of gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), linoleic acid (LA), stearidonic acid (SDA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and arachidonic acid (AA)"
"Calcium intake in vegetarians and vegans can be similar to non-vegetarians, as long as the diet is properly planned"
" Lacto-ovo vegetarians that include dairy products can still obtain calcium from dairy sources like milk, yogurt, and cheese"
"Non-dairy milks that are fortified with calcium, such as soymilk and almond milk can also contribute a significant amount of calcium in the diet"
" The calcium found in broccoli, bok choy, and kale have also been found to have calcium that is well absorbed in the body"
" Though the calcium content per serving is lower in these vegetables than a glass of milk, the absorption of the calcium into the body is higher"
" Other foods that contain calcium include calcium-set tofu, blackstrap molasses, turnip greens, mustard greens, soybeans, tempeh, almonds, okra, dried figs, and tahini"
" Though calcium can be found in Spinach, swiss chard, beans and beet greens, they are generally not considered to be a good source since the calcium binds to oxalic acid and is poorly absorbed into the body"
" Phytic acid found in nuts, seeds, and beans may also impact calcium absorption rates"
" See the National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements for calcium needs for various ages, the Vegetarian Resource Group and the Vegetarian Nutrition Calcium Fact Sheet from the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics for more specifics on how to obtain adequate calcium intake on a vegetarian or vegan diet"
Vitamin D needs can be met via the human body's own generation upon sufficient and sensible exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light in sunlight
" Products including milk, soy milk and cereal grains may be fortified to provide a source of Vitamin D"
" For those who do not get adequate sun exposure or food sources, Vitamin D supplementation may be necessary"
"Vitamin D2, or ergocalciferol is found in fungus (except alfalfa which is a plantae) and created from viosterol, which in turn is created when ultraviolet light activates ergosterol (which is found in fungi and named as a sterol from ergot)"
 Any UV-irradiated fungus including yeast form vitamin D2
 Human bioavailability of vitamin D2 from vitamin D2-enhanced button mushrooms via UV-B irradiation is effective in improving vitamin D status and not different from a vitamin D2 supplement according to study
" For example, Vitamin D2 from UV-irradiated yeast baked into bread is bioavailable"
"By visual assessment or using a chromometer, no significant discoloration of irradiated mushrooms, as measured by the degree of ""whiteness"", was observed making it hard to discover if they have been treated without labeling"
 Claims have been made that a normal serving (approx
" 3 oz or 1/2 cup, or 60 grams) of mushrooms treated with ultraviolet light increase their vitamin D content to levels up to 80 micrograms, or 2700 IU if exposed to just 5 minutes of UV light after being harvested"
Choline is a nutrient that helps transfer signals between nerve cells and is involved in liver function
 It is highest in dairy foods and meat but it is possible to be obtained through a vegan diet
"With regard to the ethics of eating meat, scholars consider vegetarianism an ideology and a social movement"
 Ethical reasons for choosing vegetarianism vary and are usually predicated on the interests of non-human animals
" In many societies, controversy and debate have arisen over the ethics of eating animals"
" Some people, while not vegetarians, refuse to eat the flesh of certain animals due to cultural taboo, such as cats, dogs, horses or rabbits"
" Others support meat eating for scientific, nutritional and cultural reasons, including religious ones"
" Some meat eaters abstain from the meat of animals reared in particular ways, such as factory farms, or avoid certain meats, such as veal or foie gras"
" Some people follow vegetarian or vegan diets not because of moral concerns involving the raising or consumption of animals in general, but because of concerns about the specific treatment and practices involved in the processing of animals for food"
 Others still avoid meat because meat production is claimed to place a greater burden on the environment than production of an equivalent amount of plant protein
" Ethical objections based on consideration for animals are generally divided into opposition to the act of killing in general, and opposition to certain agricultural practices surrounding the production of meat"
"Ethical vegetarians believe that killing an animal, like killing a human, especially one who has equal or lesser cognitive abilities than the animals in question, can only be justified in extreme circumstances and that consuming a living creature for its enjoyable taste, convenience, or nutrition value is not a sufficient cause"
" Another common view is that humans are morally conscious of their behavior in a way other animals are not, and therefore subject to higher standards"
 Jeff McMahan proposes that denying the right to life and humane treatment to animals with equal or greater cognitive abilities than mentally disabled humans is an arbitrary and discriminatory practice based on habit instead of logic
 Opponents of ethical vegetarianism argue that animals are not moral equals to humans and so consider the comparison of eating livestock with killing people to be fallacious
" This view does not excuse cruelty, but maintains that animals do not possess the rights a human has"
"One of the main differences between a vegan and a lacto-ovo vegetarian diet is the avoidance of both eggs and dairy products such as milk, cheese, butter and yogurt"
 Ethical vegans do not consume dairy or eggs because they state that their production causes the animal suffering or a premature death
"To produce milk from dairy cattle, farmers separate calves from their mothers soon after birth to retain cow milk for human consumption"
"Ethical vegetarianism has become popular in developed countries particularly because of the spread of factory farming, faster communications,[citation needed] and environmental consciousness"
" Some believe that the current mass-demand for meat cannot be satisfied without a mass-production system that disregards the welfare of animals, while others believe that practices like well-managed free-range farming or the consumption of game (particularly from species whose natural predators have been significantly eliminated) could substantially alleviate consumer demand for mass-produced meat"
Jainism teaches vegetarianism as moral conduct as do some major sects of Hinduism
" Buddhism in general does not prohibit meat eating, while Mahayana Buddhism encourages vegetarianism as beneficial for developing compassion"
" Other denominations that advocate a vegetarian diet include the Seventh-day Adventists, the Rastafari movement, the Ananda Marga movement and the Hare Krishnas"
 Sikhism does not equate spirituality with diet and does not specify a vegetarian or meat diet
"While there are no dietary restrictions in the Baháʼí Faith, `Abdu'l-Bahá, the son of the religion's founder, noted that a vegetarian diet consisting of fruits and grains was desirable, except for people with a weak constitution or those that are sick"
" He stated that there are no requirements that Baháʼís become vegetarian, but that a future society should gradually become vegetarian"
 `Abdu'l-Bahá also stated that killing animals was contrary to compassion
" While Shoghi Effendi, the head of the Bahá'í Faith in the first half of the 20th century, stated that a purely vegetarian diet would be preferable since it avoided killing animals, both he and the Universal House of Justice, the governing body of the Baháʼís have stated that these teachings do not constitute a Baháʼí practice and that Baháʼís can choose to eat whatever they wish but should be respectful of others' beliefs"
Theravadins in general eat meat
" If Buddhist monks ""see, hear or know"" a living animal was killed specifically for them to eat, they must refuse it or else incur an offense"
" However, this does not include eating meat which was given as alms or commercially purchased"
" In the Theravada canon, Buddha did not make any comment discouraging them from eating meat (except specific types, such as human, elephant, horse, dog, snake, lion, tiger, leopard, bear, and hyena flesh) but he specifically refused to institute vegetarianism in his monastic code when a suggestion had been made"
"In several Sanskrit texts of Mahayana Buddhism, Buddha instructs his followers to avoid meat"
" However, each branch of Mahayana Buddhism selects which sutra to follow, and some branches, including the majority of Tibetan and Japanese Buddhists, do eat meat, while many Chinese Buddhist branches do not"
Various groups within Christianity have practiced specific dietary restrictions for various reasons
" The Council of Jerusalem in around 50 AD, recommended Christians keep following some of the Jewish food laws concerning meat"
 The early sect known as the Ebionites are considered to have practiced vegetarianism
 Surviving fragments from their Gospel indicate their belief that – as Christ is the Passover sacrifice and eating the Passover lamb is no longer required – a vegetarian diet may (or should) be observed
" However, orthodox Christianity does not accept their teaching as authentic"
" Indeed, their specific injunction to strict vegetarianism was cited as one of the Ebionites' ""errors"""
"At a much later time, the Bible Christian Church founded by Reverend William Cowherd in 1809 followed a vegetarian diet"
 Cowherd was one of the philosophical forerunners of the Vegetarian Society
 Cowherd encouraged members to abstain from eating of meat as a form of temperance
"Seventh-day Adventists are encouraged to engage in healthy eating practices, and ovo-lacto-vegetarian diets are recommended by the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists Nutrition Council (GCNC)"
 They have also sponsored and participated in many scientific studies exploring the impact of dietary decisions upon health outcomes
 The GCNC has in addition adapted the USDA's food pyramid for a vegetarian dietary approach
" However, the only kinds of meat specifically frowned upon by the SDA health message are unclean meats, or those forbidden in scripture"
"Additionally, some monastic orders follow a pescatarian diet, and members of the Eastern Orthodox Church follow a vegan diet during fasts"
 There is also a strong association between the Quakers and vegetarianism dating back at least to the 18th century
" The association grew in prominence during the 19th century, coupled with growing Quaker concerns in connection with alcohol consumption, anti-vivisection and social purity"
" The association between the Quaker tradition and vegetarianism, however, becomes most significant with the founding of the Friends' Vegetarian Society in 1902 ""to spread a kindlier way of living amongst the Society of Friends"
"According to Canon Law, Roman Catholics ages 14 and older are required to abstain from meat, other than fish, on Ash Wednesday and all Fridays of Lent including Good Friday"
" Canon Law also obliges Catholics to abstain from meat, other than fish, on the Fridays of the year outside of Lent (excluding certain holy days) unless, with the permission of the local conference of bishops, another penitential act is substituted"
 The restrictions on eating meat on these days is solely as an act of penance and not because of a religious objection to eating meat
"Since the formation of the Seventh-day Adventist Church in the 1860s when the church began, wholeness and health have been an emphasis of the Adventist church, and has been known as the ""health message"" belief of the church"
 Adventists are well known for presenting a health message that recommends vegetarianism and expects adherence to the kosher laws in Leviticus 11
" Obedience to these laws means abstinence from pork, shellfish, and other animals proscribed as ""unclean"""
" The church discourages its members from consuming alcoholic beverages, tobacco or illegal drugs (compare Christianity and alcohol)"
" In addition, some Adventists avoid coffee, tea, cola, and other beverages containing caffeine"
"The pioneers of the Adventist Church had much to do with the common acceptance of breakfast cereals into the Western diet, and the ""modern commercial concept of cereal food"" originated among Adventists"
 John Harvey Kellogg was one of the early founders of Adventist health work
 His development of breakfast cereals as a health food led to the founding of Kellogg's by his brother William
" In both Australia and New Zealand, the church-owned Sanitarium Health and Wellbeing Company is a leading manufacturer of health and vegetarian-related products, most prominently Weet-Bix"
Research funded by the U
 National Institutes of Health has shown that the average Adventist in California lives 4 to 10 years longer than the average Californian
" The research, as cited by the cover story of the November 2005 issue of National Geographic, asserts that Adventists live longer because they do not smoke or drink alcohol, have a day of rest every week, and maintain a healthy, low-fat vegetarian diet that is rich in nuts and beans"
 The cohesiveness of Adventists' social networks has also been put forward as an explanation for their extended lifespan
"Since Dan Buettner's 2005 National Geographic story about Adventist longevity, his book, The Blue Zones: Lessons for Living Longer From the People Who've Lived the Longest, named Loma Linda, California a ""blue zone"" because of the large concentration of Seventh-day Adventists"
" He cites the Adventist emphasis on health, diet, and Sabbath-keeping as primary factors for Adventist longevity"
"An estimated 35% of Adventists practice vegetarianism or veganism, according to a 2002 worldwide survey of local church leaders"
 North American Adventist health study recruitments from 2001-2007 found a similar prevalence of vegetarianism/veganism
" A small majority of Adventists, 54%, were conventional meat-eaters"
" Of the remaining 46% it was found that 28% were Ovo/Lacto-vegetarians, 10% were Pesco-vegetarians and 8% were vegans"
 It’s common for Adventists who choose to eat meat to follow highly vegetarian diets; 6% of the “meat-eaters” group restricted their intake of meat/fish to no more than once per week
"Though there is no strict rule on what to consume and what not to, paths of Hinduism hold vegetarianism as an ideal"
" Some reasons are: the principle of nonviolence (ahimsa) applied to animals; the intention to offer only ""pure"" (vegetarian) food to a deity and then to receive it back as prasad; and the conviction that a satvic diet is beneficial for a healthy body and mind and that non-vegetarian food is not recommended for a better mind and for spiritual development"
" A sattvic diet is lacto-vegetarian where it can include dairy, but excludes eggs"
"However, the food habits of Hindus vary according to their community, location, custom and varying traditions"
" Historically and currently, those Hindus who eat meat prescribe jhatka meat, Hindus believe that the cow is a holy animal whose processing for meat is forbidden"
"Some followers of Islam, or Muslims, chose to be vegetarian for health, ethical, or personal reasons"
" However, the choice to become vegetarian for non-medical reasons can sometimes be controversial due to conflicting fatwas and differing interpretations of the Quran"
" Though some more traditional Muslims may keep quiet about their vegetarian diet, the number of vegetarian Muslims is increasing"
"Vegetarianism has been practiced by some influential Muslims including the Iraqi theologian, female mystic and poet Rabia of Basra, who died in the year 801, the Sufi mystic and poet Rumi and the Sri Lankan Sufi master Bawa Muhaiyaddeen, who established The Bawa Muhaiyaddeen Fellowship of North America in Philadelphia"
 The former Indian president Dr
 Abdul Kalam was also famously a vegetarian
"In January 1996, The International Vegetarian Union announced the formation of the Muslim Vegetarian/Vegan Society"
Many non-vegetarian Muslims will select vegetarian (or seafood) options when dining in non-halal restaurants
" However, this is a matter of not having the right kind of meat rather than preferring not to eat meat on the whole"
"Followers of Jainism believe that all living organisms, including microorganisms, are living and have a soul, and have one or more senses out of five senses"
 They go to great lengths to minimise any harm to any living organism
" Most Jains are lacto-vegetarians, but more devout Jains do not eat root vegetables, because they believe that root vegetables contain many more microorganisms as compared to other vegetables, and that, by eating them, violence against these microorganisms is inevitable"
" They therefore prefer eating beans and fruits, whose cultivation involves killing fewer microorganisms"
 No products obtained from already-dead animals are allowed because of potential violence against decomposing microorganisms
 Some particularly dedicated individuals are fruitarians
" Honey is forbidden, being the regurgitation of nectar by bees  and potentially containing eggs, excreta and dead bees"
" Some Jains do not consume plant parts that grow underground such as roots and bulbs, because the plants themselves and tiny animals may be killed when the plants are pulled up"
"While classical Jewish law neither requires nor prohibits the consumption of meat, Jewish vegetarians often cite Jewish principles regarding animal welfare, environmental ethics, moral character, and health as reasons for adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet"
"Rabbis may advocate vegetarianism or veganism primarily because of concerns about animal welfare, especially in light of the traditional prohibition on causing unnecessary ""pain to living creatures"" (tza'ar ba'alei hayyim)"
 Some Jewish vegetarian groups and activists believe that the halakhic permission to eat meat is a temporary leniency for those who are not ready yet to accept the vegetarian diet
The book of Daniel starts in its first chapter with the benefits of vegetarianism
" Due to its size, its late time of origin and its revealing content, the book is of particular importance for the time of the following exile, which lasts now for 2000 years and technically still goes on until the Temple in Jerusalem is rebuilt"
" A diet described as “pulse and water” is presented along benefits such as accordance with the biblical dietary laws, health, beauty, wisdom and visions"
 Vegetarianism can be seen as a safeguard around the dietary laws or the beautification of them
Jewish vegetarianism and veganism have become especially popular among Israeli Jews
" In 2016, Israel was described as ""the most vegan country on Earth"", as five percent of its population eschewed all animal products"
 Interest in veganism has grown among both non-Orthodox and Orthodox Jews in Israel
"Within the Afro-Caribbean community, a minority are Rastafari and follow the dietary regulations with varying degrees of strictness"
" The most orthodox eat only ""Ital"" or natural foods, in which the matching of herbs or spices with vegetables is the result of long tradition originating from the African ancestry and cultural heritage of Rastafari"
" ""Ital"", which is derived from the word vital, means essential to human existence"
" Ital cooking in its strictest form prohibits the use of salt, meat (especially pork), preservatives, colorings, flavorings and anything artificial"
 Most Rastafari are vegetarian
"The tenets of Sikhism do not advocate a particular stance on either vegetarianism or the consumption of meat, but leave the decision of diet to the individual"
" The tenth guru, Guru Gobind Singh, however, prohibited ""Amritdhari"" Sikhs, or those that follow the Sikh Rehat Maryada (the Official Sikh Code of Conduct) from eating Kutha meat, or meat which has been obtained from animals which have been killed in a ritualistic way"
" This is understood to have been for the political reason of maintaining independence from the then-new Muslim hegemony, as Muslims largely adhere to the ritualistic halal diet"
"""Amritdharis"" that belong to some Sikh sects (e"
" Akhand Kirtani Jatha, Damdami Taksal, Namdhari and Rarionwalay, etc"
") are vehemently against the consumption of meat and eggs (though they do consume and encourage the consumption of milk, butter and cheese)"
" This vegetarian stance has been traced back to the times of the British Raj, with the advent of many new Vaishnava converts"
" In response to the varying views on diet throughout the Sikh population, Sikh Gurus have sought to clarify the Sikh view on diet, stressing their preference only for simplicity of diet"
" Guru Nanak said that over-consumption of food (Lobh, Greed) involves a drain on the Earth's resources and thus on life"
" Passages from the Guru Granth Sahib (the holy book of Sikhs, also known as the Adi Granth) say that it is ""foolish"" to argue for the superiority of animal life, because though all life is related, only human life carries more importance: ""Only fools argue whether to eat meat or not"
" Who can define what is meat and what is not meat? Who knows where the sin lies, being a vegetarian or a non-vegetarian?"" The Sikh langar, or free temple meal, is largely lacto-vegetarian, though this is understood to be a result of efforts to present a meal that is respectful of the diets of any person who would wish to dine, rather than out of dogma"
"Environmental vegetarianism is based on the concern that the production of meat and animal products for mass consumption, especially through factory farming, is environmentally unsustainable"
" According to a 2006 United Nations initiative, the livestock industry is one of the largest contributors to environmental degradation worldwide, and modern practices of raising animals for food contribute on a ""massive scale"" to air and water pollution, land degradation, climate change, and loss of biodiversity"
" The initiative concluded that ""the livestock sector emerges as one of the top two or three most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems, at every scale from local to global"
"In addition, animal agriculture is a large source of greenhouse gases"
 According to a 2006 report it is responsible for 18% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions as estimated in 100-year CO2 equivalents
 Livestock sources (including enteric fermentation and manure) account for about 3
1 percent of US anthropogenic GHG emissions expressed as carbon dioxide equivalents
" This EPA estimate is based on methodologies agreed to by the Conference of Parties of the UNFCCC, with 100-year global warming potentials from the IPCC Second Assessment Report used in estimating GHG emissions as carbon dioxide equivalents"
Meat produced in a laboratory (called in vitro meat) may be more environmentally sustainable than regularly produced meat
 Reactions of vegetarians vary
" Rearing a relatively small number of grazing animals can be beneficial, as the Food Climate Research Network at Surrey University reports: ""A little bit of livestock production is probably a good thing for the environment"""
"In May 2009, Ghent, Belgium, was reported to be ""the first [city] in the world to go vegetarian at least once a week"" for environmental reasons, when local authorities decided to implement a ""weekly meatless day"""
" Civil servants would eat vegetarian meals one day per week, in recognition of the United Nations' report"
" Posters were put up by local authorities to encourage the population to take part on vegetarian days, and ""veggie street maps"" were printed to highlight vegetarian restaurants"
" In September 2009, schools in Ghent are due to have a weekly veggiedag (""vegetarian day"") too"
Public opinion and acceptance of meat-free food is expected to be more successful if its descriptive words focus less on the health aspects and more on the flavor
"Some groups, such as PETA, promote vegetarianism as a way to offset poor treatment and working conditions of workers in the contemporary meat industry"
" These groups cite studies showing the psychological damage caused by working in the meat industry, especially in factory and industrialised settings, and argue that the meat industry violates its labourers' human rights by assigning difficult and distressing tasks without adequate counselling, training and debriefing"
" However, the working conditions of agricultural workers as a whole, particularly non-permanent workers, remain poor and well below conditions prevailing in other economic sectors"
" Accidents, including pesticide poisoning, among farmers and plantation workers contribute to increased health risks, including increased mortality"
" According to the International Labour Organization, agriculture is one of the three most dangerous jobs in the world[clarification needed]"
Similar to environmental vegetarianism is the concept of economic vegetarianism
" An economic vegetarian is someone who practices vegetarianism from either the philosophical viewpoint concerning issues such as public health and curbing world starvation, the belief that the consumption of meat is economically unsound, part of a conscious simple living strategy or just out of necessity"
" According to the Worldwatch Institute, ""Massive reductions in meat consumption in industrial nations will ease their health care burden while improving public health; declining livestock herds will take pressure off rangelands and grainlands, allowing the agricultural resource base to rejuvenate"
" As populations grow, lowering meat consumption worldwide will allow more efficient use of declining per capita land and water resources, while at the same time making grain more affordable to the world's chronically hungry"
""" According to estimates in 2016, adoption of vegetarianism would contribute substantially to global healthcare and environmental savings"
Prejudice researcher Gordon Hodson argues that vegetarians and vegans frequently face discrimination where eating meat is held as a cultural norm
"Compared to omnivores, vegetarians were more open to new experiences but were also more neurotic and depressed"
"Research suggests that, at least in the United States, vegetarianism has a high turnover rate, with less than 20% of adopters persisting for more than a year"
" A 2014 study found that 84% of Americans who started a vegetarian or vegan diet eventually abandoned it, with higher retention among individuals who stayed committed for over a year"
" Research shows various reasons contribute to lapsing, such as lacking social support"
 Subsequent research supports the idea that social connection is negatively impacted by dietary restrictions
" A 2019 analysis found that adhering to any kind of restricted diet (eg; gluten-free, vegetarian, kosher, teetotal) was associated with feelings of loneliness and increased social isolation"
Vegetarians or vegans who adopted their diet abruptly were significantly more likely to eventually abandon their diet when compared to individuals adopting their diet gradually with incremental changes
"A 1992 market research study conducted by the Yankelovich research organisation concluded that ""of the 12"
"4 million people [in the US] who call themselves vegetarian, 68% are female, while only 32% are male"""
 Subsequent research has consistently found that vegetarians are more likely to be female than male
 In 2019 the female-to-male ratio of vegetarians was similar to what was found in the 1992 study
" Multiple causes may explain this, including gendered differences in values, attitudes towards dieting, gender roles and socialisation and differences in health concerns"
 Women are more likely than men to be vegetarian for prosocial and values-based reasons
 They are also more likely to adhere to their vegetarian diets than men
At least one study indicates that vegetarian women are more likely to have female babies
" A study of 6,000 pregnant women in 1998 ""found that while the national average in Britain is 106 boys born to every 100 girls, for vegetarian mothers the ratio was just 85 boys to 100 girls"""
"In 2020 YouGov published the results of 2019 research surveying 1,491 Americans"
 The results showed 7
17% of respondents followed some type of meatless diet: 2
"26% reported being vegan, 4"
91% reported being vegetarian
58% reported being pescetarian
 A major finding in this study was that meat-consumption was positively correlated with higher age
 The younger Americans were less likely to be meat-eaters; a total of 15 percent of adults under 39 say they are vegan or vegetarian
 Other research has estimated a lower prevalence; one study found that 7
"5% Millennials and Gen-Z were vegetarian/vegan, but this prevalence is still significantly higher than that of older generations"
The rate of vegetarianism by country can vary substantially from relatively low levels in countries such as the Netherlands (5%) to extremely high levels in India (20–40%)
" Estimates for the number of vegetarians per country can be subject to methodological difficulties, as respondents may identify as vegetarian even if they include some meat in their diet, and thus some researchers suggest the percentage of vegetarians may be significantly overestimated"
Vegetarian cuisine is based on food that meets vegetarian standards by not including meat and animal tissue products (such as gelatin or animal-derived rennet)
 Lacto-ovo vegetarianism (the most common type of vegetarianism in the Western world) includes eggs and dairy products (such as milk and cheese without rennet)
" Lacto vegetarianism includes dairy products but not eggs, and ovo vegetarianism encompasses eggs but not dairy products"
" The strictest form of vegetarianism is veganism, which excludes all animal products, including dairy, honey, and some refined sugars if filtered and whitened with bone char"
" There are also partial vegetarians, such as pescetarians who eat fish but avoid other types of meat"
"There are a wide range of possible vegetarian foods, including some developed to particularly suit a vegetarian/vegan diet, either by filling the culinary niche where recipes would otherwise have meat, or by ensuring healthy intake of protein, B12 vitamin, and other nutrients"
Food regarded as suitable for all vegetarians (including vegans) typically includes:
"Foods not suitable for vegans, but acceptable for some other types of vegetarians:"
"Vegetarians by definition cannot consume meat or animal tissue products, with no other universally adopted change in their diet"
" However, in practice, compared to non-vegetarians, vegetarians on average have an increased consumption in:"
"And in comparison to non-vegetarians, practising vegetarians on average have a decreased consumption in:"
"This difference is observed, but is not required to be vegetarian"
 Nevertheless it is relevant when considering research into the health effects of adopting a vegetarian diet
" A diet consisting only of sugar candies, for example, while technically also vegetarian, would be expected to have a much different outcome for health compared to what is called ""a vegetarian diet"" culturally and what is most commonly adopted by vegetarians"
These are some of the most common dishes that vegetarians eat without substitution of ingredients
" Such dishes include, from breakfasts to dinnertime desserts:"
"Most desserts, including pies, cobblers, cakes, brownies, cookies, truffles, Rice Krispie treats (from gelatin-free marshmallows or marshmallow fluff), peanut butter treats, pudding, rice pudding, ice cream, crème brulée, etc"
", are free of meat and fish and are suitable for ovo-lacto vegetarians"
" Eastern confectionery and desserts, such as halva and Turkish delight, are mostly vegan, while others such as baklava (which often contains butter) are lacto vegetarian"
" Indian desserts and sweets are mostly vegetarian like peda, barfi, gulab jamun, shrikhand, basundi, kaju katri, rasgulla, cham cham, rajbhog, etc"
 Indian sweets are mostly made from milk products and are thus lacto vegetarian; dry fruit-based sweets are vegan
A meat analogue is a meat-like substance made from plants
" More common terms are plant-based meat, vegan meat, meat substitute, mock meat, meat alternative, imitation meat, or vegetarian meat, or, sometimes more pejoratively, fake meat or faux meat"
" Meat analogues typically approximate certain aesthetic qualities (such as texture, flavor, appearance) or chemical characteristics of specific types of meat"
" Generally, meat analogue means a food made from vegetarian ingredients, and sometimes without animal products such as dairy"
  Many analogues are soy-based (e
" tofu, tempeh) or gluten-based, but now may also be made from pea protein"
 Other less common analogues include ingredients like mycoprotein
"Because of their similarity to meats, they are frequently used in dishes and food practices similar to meat"
" The target market for meat analogues includes vegetarians, vegans, non-vegetarians seeking to reduce their meat consumption, and people following religious dietary laws in Hinduism, Judaism, Islam, and Buddhism"
"Increasingly, the global demand for sustainable diets in response to the outsized role animal products play in global warming and other environmental impacts has seen an increase in industries focused on finding substitutes similar to meat"
" However, the motivation for seeking out mock meats tends to vary depending on consumer group"
" The market for meat alternatives is highly dependent on ""meat-reducers"" — a consumer group who is primarily motivated by health consciousness and weight management"
" Consumers who identify as vegan, vegetarian or pescetarian are more likely to endorse concerns regarding animal welfare and/or environmentalism as primary motivators"
Meat substitution has a long history
" Tofu, a popular meat analogue made from soybeans, was known in China during the period of the Western Han dynasty (206 BCE – 9 CE)"
" A document written by Tao Gu (903–970) describes how tofu was called ""small mutton"" and valued as an imitation meat"
 Meat analogues such as tofu and wheat gluten are associated with Buddhist cuisine in China and other parts of East Asia
" In Medieval Europe, meat analogues were popular during the Christian observance of Lent, when the consumption of meat from warm-blooded animals is forbidden"
"Commercial products, marketed especially towards vegetarians and labeled as such, are available in most countries worldwide, in varying amounts and quality"
" As example, in Australia, various vegetarian products are available in most of supermarket chains and a vegetarian shopping guide is provided by Vegetarian/Vegan Society of Queensland"
" However, the biggest market for commercially vegetarian-labeled foods is India, with official governmental laws regulating the ""vegetarian"" and ""non vegetarian"" labels"
Vegetarian diets are associated with a number of favorable health outcomes in epidemiological studies
" In a study supported by a National Institutes of Health grant, dietary patterns were evaluated along with their relationship with metabolic risk factors and metabolic syndromes"
" A cross-sectional analysis of 773 subjects including 35% vegetarians, 16% semi-vegetarians, and 49% non-vegetarians found that a vegetarian dietary pattern is associated significantly with lower means for all metabolic risk factors except HDL, and a lower risk of metabolic syndromes when compared to non-vegetarian diets"
" Metabolic risk factors include HDL, triglycerides, glucose, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, waist circumference, and body mass index"
 Metabolic syndromes are a cluster of disorders associated with a heightened risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease
 Adventist Study 2 (AHS-2) compared mean consumption of each food group for vegetarian patterns compared to non-vegetarian patterns
" Health benefits can be explained by increase in certain foods, not just the lack of animal products"
"As evident by the Adventist Study 2 (AHS-2), the vegetarian diet does not always cause health benefits"
 This is dependent on the specific foods in the vegetarian diet
 The National Institute of Health recommends a 1600 calories a day lacto-ovo vegetarian cuisine for the diet
" This recommended diet includes oranges, pancakes, milk, and coffee for breakfast, vegetable soup, bagels, american cheese, and spinach salad for lunch, and omelettes, mozzarella cheese, carrots, and whole wheat bread, and tea for dinner"
What is Vegetarianism? is a 1886 pamphlet written by John E
 Mayor on vegetarianism
"Reverend Professor John Eyton Bickersteth Mayor, born in Baddegama, Ceylon, in 1825, was an English scholar and writer"
 Mayor became a strict vegetarian and teetotaller
" He was also librarian and a professor at the University of Cambridge, and as noted in Cassell's Family Magazine, a ""well-known classical scholar"
"At thirteen years old, Moore had eschewed all animal products for a whole Lent"
 He later returned to a mixed diet of vegetables and meat
" He did, however, experiment with rationing foods, and researched the problems with tea drinking"
" Approximately two decades later, he listed several reasons, which he would repeat to friends, upon his changing to a strictly vegetable diet"
" Some of these reasons were, that ""ten of us can live where one flesh-eater pure and simple must starve,"" because ""homo sapiens are closest to fruit-eating apes rather than flesh-eating beasts of prey,"" and that ""fruit and seeds uproot the drink crave"
""" He also noted that he has derived inspiration for this diet from the ""sages [of] earlier epochs,"" such as Pythagoras, Socrates, Plato, Epicurus, Masinissa, Plutarch, Seneca, Musonius, Clement, Chrysostom, Bernard, Cyrus, Decius, Fabricicuis, and General Gordon"
"Mayor became a member of the Vegetarian Society in 1881, and as British academic Hugh Fraser Stewart writes, ""to its great advantage and his own"
""" He became the President of the Vegetarian Society in 1883"
" Many of Mayor's vegetarian writings were published in the book, Plain Living and High Thinking in 1897"
" Mayor died in 1910, in Cambridge"
"Mayor delivered the address ""What is Vegetarianism?"" before the Vegetarian Society, at its annual meeting, in Manchester, on October 14th, 1885"
" At the time of the meeting, Mayor was a professor of Latin, and a Senior Fellow of St"
" John's College, in Cambridge"
"An early edition of What is Vegetarianism? was printed at Manchester, by the Vegetarian Society, in 1886"
"The third edition, which was published in 1889, is 16 pages in total length, and printed in a demy octavo collation"
" ""What is Vegetarianism?"" appears within a collection of Mayor's writings, entitled Plain Living and High Thinking, which was published in 1897"
" In the same year, it was split into two editions of the monthly periodical The Vegetarian,  the first half of the essay appearing in the July 15th edition, and the second half in the August 15th edition"
"A revised and englarged version of the third edition, which is 22 pages long and printed in a demy octavo collation, was published in 1898, by the Vegetarian Society, at 19 Oxford Street, in Manchester, London"
" It was 22 x 13 cm, and the cost was one penny"
" This version contains twenty notes, which includes a diagram, as well as fancy font"
Editions of What is Vegetarianism? are held at public and university libraries in England and Scotland
"Mayor opens ""What is Vegetarianism?"" by referencing British surgeon and polymath Sir Henry Thompson's assertions from 1879 editions of Nineteenth Century, on the vegetable diet, the land maintenance to support it, when compared to one which utilizes meat"
 He then proposes to investigate
"—The profession and practice of Vegetarians in regard to the consumption of animal products, i"
", milk with butter and cheese; eggs, honey"
—The profession of a Greek and a Roman—Pythagoras and Musonius—to whom no one denies the name Vegetarians
"—The physical distinction between flesh and animal products, as attested by the low or antiphlogistic regimen of the medical faculty"
"—The moral distinction between the same, as attested by church rules of fasting"
"—The origin and meaning of the word Vegetarian, considered philologically"
"Addressing the use of the word vegetarian, Mayor writes that if ""we called ourselves botanophagists, or phytophagists, or cerealians, that would not of necessity imply the exclusive, but only the customary use of vegetable diet or of grain"
" Two little words continually skulk into the definition of our name—only and all,"" adding that when ""librarian means an ""eater of books,"" antiquarian ""an eater of antiques,"" even then vegetarian will not, cannot, mean ""an eater of vegetables"
This is discussed by the English librarian and vegetarian activist William E
" Axon, in the weekly academic periodical Notes and Queries, who wrote that ""those interested will find in this address a further discussion of the subject by both English and German writers,"" adding that ""it may be well to add that the word ""vegetarian"" came into vogue with the establishment of the Vegetarian Society in 1847, and has not been traced further back than 1845"
""" Axon offers for any interested readers who wish to know more about vegetarianism to ""send me a postcard,"" at 257, Deansgate, Manchester, and ""I shall be happy to send them some information on the matter"
"In 1886 work Juvenal, which is a supplement to the poems of Latin author Juvenal, Mayor notes that he has ""corrected Sir Henry's error, shared by Prof"
" Skeat and other lexicographers, as to the origin and meaning of the term Vegetarianism"
 It also occurs in Ed
 Hartmann's attack on Vegetarianism ('was sollen wir essen?' in his 'Moderne Probleme' Leipz
"At the end of the work, is an advertisement by the Vegetarian Society for two other works by Mayor, Plain Living and High Thinking, for one shilling, and Mercy not Curiosity, the Mother of Medicine, for one penny"
"In an article entitled ""What is Vegetarianism"" in the February 1, 1910 edition of the periodical Good Health, the author writes that there ""appear[s] to be a number of misapprehensions concerning [the vegetarian diet]"
""" They write ""in a few words, it mean wholesome living,"" quoting Mayor in that the word is a derivative of the Latin vegeo, which means to thrive and be strong"
" He closes with remarking that the word vegetable is a reference to plant foods because ""the plant is conceived as giving life power"
"Ovo vegetarianism /ˈoʊvoʊ/ is a type of vegetarianism which allows for the consumption of eggs but not dairy products, in contrast with lacto vegetarianism"
 Those who practice ovo vegetarianism are called ovo-vegetarians
" ""Ovo"" comes from the Latin word for egg"
Ethical motivations for excluding dairy products are based on issues with the industrial practices behind the production of milk
 Concerns include the practice of keeping a cow constantly pregnant in order for her to lactate and the slaughter of unwanted male calves
 Other concerns include the standard practice of separating the mother from her calf and denying the calf its natural source of milk
"  This contrasts with the industrial practices surrounding egg-laying hens, which produce eggs for human consumption without being fertilized"
"  Ovo-vegetarians often prefer free-range eggs, that is, those produced by uncaged hens"
" Many ovo-vegetarians refuse to eat fertilized eggs, with balut being an extreme example where the egg has developed"
"Some vegetarians are lactose intolerant and have a casein allergy, and are therefore unwilling to consume milk or other dairy products"
"Carbon emissions associated with keeping hens are less than those associated with cattle, a factor significant to those practicing environmental vegetarianism"
[citation needed]
Ethical concerns about the consumption of eggs arise from the practice of culling male chicks shortly after birth
 Practices considered humane for chick culling include maceration and suffocation using carbon dioxide
One of the main differences between a vegan and an ovo-vegetarian diet is the avoidance of eggs
 Vegans do not consume eggs under any circumstances

Christian vegetarianism is the practice of keeping to a vegetarian lifestyle for reasons connected to or derived from the Christian faith
" The three primary reasons are spiritual, nutritional, and ethical"
" The ethical reasons may include a concern for God's creation, a concern for animal rights and welfare, or both"
" Likewise, Christian veganism is the abstaining from the use of all animal products for reasons connected to or derived from the Christian faith"
"Pescatarianism was widespread in the early Church, among both the clergy and laity"
"Some religious orders of various Christian Churches practice pescatarianism, including the Benedictines, Franciscans, Trappists, Carthusians and Cistercians"
" Various Church leaders have recommended vegetarianism, including John Wesley (founder of the Methodist Church), William and Catherine Booth (founders of The Salvation Army), William Cowherd from the Bible Christian Church and Ellen G"
 White from the Seventh-day Adventists
" Cowherd, who founded the Bible Christian Church in 1809, helped to establish the world's first Vegetarian Society in 1847"
Organizations such as the Christian Vegetarian Association (CVA) actively work to promote the concept
"Additionally, many Christians may choose to practice vegetarianism as their Lenten sacrifice during the penetential season of Lent"
Christian vegetarianism has not been a common dietary choice throughout Church history
" Some[who?] have argued, however, that ""there is a long-standing tradition of vegetarianism in Christian history"
""" The two most prominent forms are a spirituality-based vegetarianism (where vegetarianism is adopted as an ascetic practice, or as a way of opposing the sin of gluttony, in the hope it will draw the person to God) and an ethically-based vegetarianism (where it is adopted for ethical reasons; for example, those to do with the treatment of non-human animals)"
 Christian ethical vegetarianism (or veganism) usually carries with it a commitment to the normative claim that (at least some) Christians should be vegetarians
" For this reason, Christian ethical vegetarians often give a scriptural justification for their position"
"  While there are biblical passages which provide support for ethical vegetarianism, there are also passages which seem to imply that eating animals is morally permissible"
One of the most important passages for Christian vegetarians is the first creation narrative in the book of Genesis
" After creating humans, God addresses them in chapter 1, verses 29–30 as follows:"
"God said, ""See, I have given you every plant yielding seed that is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree with seed in its fruit; you shall have them for food"
"  And to every beast of the earth, and to every bird of the air, and to everything that creeps on the earth, everything that has the breath of life, I have given every green plant for food"""
"In this passage, God prescribes a plant-based diet not just for humans, but for all land-based non-human animals"
" Christian vegetarians and vegans point out that it was this creation—where all creatures ate plants—that God then declared ""very good"" in verse 31"
" Moreover, that God's initial creation was a vegan creation suggests that this is how God intended all his creatures to live"
 This idea—that God intended for all his creatures to eat plants—is sometimes further supported by noting that the vision of the Peaceable Kingdom found in Isaiah suggests that God will one day restore creation to such a state
  Isaiah 11:6–9 reads:
"The wolf shall live with the lamb, the leopard shall lie down with the kid, the calf and the lion and the fatling together, and a little child shall lead them"
" The cow and the bear shall graze, their young shall lie down together; and the lion shall eat straw like the ox"
" The nursing child shall play over the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put its hand on the adder’s den"
 They will not hurt or destroy on all my holy mountain; for the earth will be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea
Some Christian vegetarians have suggested that this eschatological view provides reasons to adopt a vegetarian or vegan diet here and now
" Moreover, the point has often been made that the dominion which humans are given over the non-human animals in Genesis 1:26–28 must be understood in light of Genesis 1:29–30 which decrees a plant-based diet for all creatures"
" Genesis 1:26–28 has, it is acknowledged by Christian vegetarians, often been used to justify the eating of animals"
" But this is a mistake, they suggest"
"  Once it is recognized that humans are given dominion over creation, and that in the very next verse humans are prescribed a plant-based diet, it will become apparent that dominion should be understood in terms of stewardship or servant-hood: humans are called to rule creation in the sense of caring for it and seeking its flourishing, just as a good Sovereign would seek the flourishing of his or her realm"
" In a survey of the scholarly literature on the relevant Hebrew terms, Carol J"
" Adams lists governing, ruling, shepherding, caring-for, nurturing, and leading about as potential ways of understanding dominion, and notes that the common characteristic of these concepts ""is their benignity"""
"The opening chapters of Genesis are, of course, only the beginning of the biblical story"
"  And just as there are passages which can be cited in support of a Christian vegetarianism or veganism, so there are passages which suggest that eating animals is morally permissible"
  The most problematic passages for Christian vegetarians are those which include an explicit permission to eat animals
  Genesis 9:3–4 is the first such example
"  In this verse, God tells Noah and his family that animals will now be their food, although they are not to eat animal flesh which contains blood"
[Genesis 9:3–4] This new situation – that of humans eating animals – is then taken largely for granted in much of the biblical narrative
" Leviticus 11 records God giving the Israelites rules about what types of meat may be eaten, which implies that certain meats were acceptable"
" During the Exodus out of Egypt, God commanded that all of the Israelites to slaughter a lamb and eat it, and instituted the Passover as a lasting tradition to remember God's saving them"
Some Jewish and Christian vegetarians have attempted to minimize the importance of these passages
"  It has been suggested, for example, that God's permitting Noah and his family to eat meat was only ever intended as a temporary permission, and was given because all the plants had been destroyed as a result of the flood"
" Others interpret the permission given to Noah and his family in Genesis 9:3–4, not as a free pass to kill animals for food because ""no matter what you do you can never remove all the blood from the flesh of a slaughtered animal"", but as an invitation to scavenge for and eat dead animals if any are found"
" These approaches are put under pressure, however, with the sheer number of passages which appear to presuppose the legitimacy of eating animals, and the normalcy with which meat eating is treated"
Another approach to these texts is to suggest that God reluctantly permitted the eating of animals due to human sinfulness
"  In other words, God permitted humans to eat non-human animals as a concession to the Fallen state of humanity"
" Richard Young raises the possibility that both the introduction of animals into the human diet, and the use of animals in religious sacrifices, were concessions to a Fallen humanity that were used to deal with humanity where it was at"
" This approach allows the Christian vegetarian or vegan to take the entire biblical witness seriously, while also holding that God's preference is for a peace and shalom throughout creation"
"Other passages of relevance to the practice of vegetarianism include Numbers 11, where the Israelites tired of manna, a food of which ""The Rabbis of the Talmud held that […] had whatever taste and flavor the eater desired at the time of eating"" and which probably was not an animal product"
"  Manna was given to the Israelites by God, but they complained about it and wanted meat instead"
"[Numbers 11:4–10] They were condemned for this, although God relented and gave them meat, which then made them ill"
"[Numbers 11:32–34] Because of their lust, the place where the incident happened became known as Kibroth Hattaavah"
A donkey temporarily given the ability to speak showed Balaam more than signs of sentience
[Numbers 22:21–33]
Some people believe that the Book of Daniel also specifically promotes veganism as empowering
" Daniel specifically refuses the king's ""meat"" (paṯbaḡ, Strong's #5698) and instead requests vegetables (zērōʿîm, Strong's #2235)"
"[Daniel 1:8–16] However, current common theology argues that in this instance Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah are rejecting food that is considered to be unholy by their faith (eating food that had been sacrificed to pagan gods), and not meat per se, despite that ""at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king's meat"""
"Philo says that the Essenes, ""being more scrupulous than any in the worship of God […] do not sacrifice animals […], but hold it right to dedicate their own hearts as a worthy offering"""
" They maintained that the sacrifices ""polluted"" the Temple"
"The Christian Vegetarian Association of the UK claims that the word ""meat"" is not used in any one instance in the authorized version of either the Old or New Testament as relating only to animal food (e"
" The CVA states that when the first English translations of the Bible were created, the word for ""meat"" meant food in general"
" When any particular kind of food was designated, it was referred to as meal, flour or grain"
"According to the CVS, examples of New Testament words that were translated as ""meat"" include: broma (""that which is eaten""/usage: 16 times ); brosimos (""eatable""/usage: 1 time); brosis (""act of eating; that which is eaten, food; food of the souls/usage: 7 times); prosphagion (""anything eaten with bread; spoken of fish boiled or broiled""/usage: 1 time); sitometron (""a measured portion of grain or food""/usage: 1 time); trapeza (""a table on which food is placed, an eating place""/usage: 1 time); trophe (""food, nourishment""/usage: 13 times); phago (""to eat, to take food, eat a meal, devour, consume""/usage: 3 times)"
"Christian vegetarians and vegans often appeal to the ethic that Jesus embodied, and called people to emulate, in making their case for a distinctively Christian vegetarianism"
"  To begin with, Jesus inaugurated the Kingdom of God, but his Kingdom didn't involve the exercise of power as humans tend to think of it"
"  As Andrew Linzey argues, Christ's power is ""the power to serve"""
" Human beings are called to have the same mind that was found in Jesus Christ, i"
", the mind to exercise power in service"
"[Philippians 2:5–9] And by considering Jesus's life, it is possible to get an idea of what that service means"
"  Sarah Withrow King writes that Jesus ""loved the unlovable"
"  In first-century Palestine, the unlovable were women, children, sick people, poor people, Roman soldiers, zealots, lepers, the blind, the outcast"", and so on"
" But today, the unlovable should include those non-human animals who are farmed for food in systems which preclude their flourishing and result in their (often painful) deaths"
Christian vegetarians also stress the importance Jesus laid on peace and inclusion
" These and other aspects of Jesus's attitudes towards others are used to extract ethical principles which, according to Christian vegetarians and vegans, lead one to a vegetarian or vegan lifestyle"
  Sarah Withrow King summarizes the point like this:
"Aware of the suffering and pain experienced by animals raised and killed for food, with a knowledge of the immense waste of natural resources and subsequent impact on both our fellow humans and the rest of creation, and acknowledging that flesh is not a dietary necessity for the vast majority of Western humans, why would we continue to participate in a system that dishonors God’s creation and perpetuates violence on a truly phenomenal scale?"
There are several passages that appear to count against the idea that vegetarianism or veganism could be mandatory for Christians
"  Some of the most challenging are those passages which speak of Jesus eating fish,[Luke 24] and Jesus telling his disciples where to catch fish, before cooking it for them to eat"
"Jesus's eating of fish is supposed to cause a problem for Christian ethical vegetarians and vegans because, if Jesus ate fish, then, since Jesus was without sin, eating fish cannot be wrong"
"  And therefore, so the argument goes, it must be permissible for Jesus's followers to eat fish"
"  The same reasoning could be used to justify the eating of any meats that Jesus ate, if it is assumed that he did indeed eat other kinds of meat (the Bible does not explicitly say Jesus ate any meat other than fish, and some writers have made much of the fact that no lamb is mentioned at the Last Supper"
"Although it is a question commonly posed to Christian vegetarians, Jesus's eating of fish (and potentially other meat) does not straightforwardly justify the eating of meat today"
"  Many Christians in the West, for example, would consider the eating of cats and dogs morally wrong"
"  Moreover, they would not change their judgement if it were claimed that the cats and dogs had ""had a good life"", or had been treated well prior to being slaughtered"
"  But any Christian who thinks that eating a cat or a dog is wrong, cannot appeal to Jesus's eating of fish (and possibly other meat) as providing a blanket permission to eat meat"
  The same point can be made by appealing to the fact that many meat-eating Christians think that foods such as foie gras or veal should not be eaten because their production involves great cruelty
"  Foie gras, for example, is produced by over-feeding—often by force-feeding—ducks and geese so that their livers become artificially enlarged beyond their natural size"
"  This controversial practice is illegal in the UK, Germany, and many other countries in Europe, as well as in Argentina, Australia, Israel, and several US states"
  Any Christian who agrees that the production and eating of foie gras is immoral cannot at the same time appeal to Jesus's eating of fish (possibly other meat) as a blanket permission to eat any meat whatever
"  The point can be put like this: the fact that Jesus ate fish (and possibly other meat) shows that, in some circumstances, it is sometimes permissible to eat some meats"
  But Jesus's eating of fish (possibly meat) doesn't show that eating meat is always justified
"  At this point in the debate, Christian vegetarians and vegans are likely to point to practices in the modern, industrialized farming system, which they think make the eating of meat produced in such farms morally problematic—practices such as, to give just one example, the mass killing of day-old male chicks from laying hens"
"Some Christian vegetarians and vegans have appealed to biblical scholarship to argue that biblical passages often need nuanced interpretation, and to guard against a wooden literalism"
"  Andy Alexis-Baker, for example, points to the work of Gerald O'Collins, SJ, who suggests that differences between the way Luke describes this appearance in Luke 24:41–43 and in Acts 1, and a tension between Luke 24:41–43 and 1 Corinthians 6, preclude us from reading this verse literally"
 This serves to caution readers of the Bible about drawing ethical conclusions from such biblical passages too quickly
"Others have explained this passage by the appealing to a so-called ""synoptic principle"""
"In the tenth chapter of the Acts of the Apostles, there is an account of a vision given to the Apostle Peter"
"  In this vision, Peter is shown a large sheet being lowered from heaven by its four corners"
"  The sheet is said to contain animals of all kinds, and Peter then hears a voice (which he interprets as a command from God) saying, ""Get up, Peter; kill and eat"""
"[Acts 10:13] Peter refuses, and the voice says ""What God has made clean, you must not call profane"""
"Many see this passage as teaching that it is permissible for Christians to eat any creatures, and that therefore while it is still permissible for Christians to follow a vegetarian or vegan diet if they wish, such a diet cannot be obligatory for any Christians"
Christian vegetarians and vegans put forward another interpretation
" To understand the meaning of Peter's vision, it is necessary to read Acts chapter 10 in its entirety"
"  The opening of the chapter recounts how a Roman Centurion named Cornelius, a devout God-fearing Gentile, himself had a vision in which he is instructed to send someone to Peter"
  Cornelius obeys
  The text then recounts how the next day Peter became hungry while he was praying
"[Acts 10:9–10] While waiting for his food, he fell into a trance and it is at this point that he receives the aforementioned vision"
"While Peter is puzzling over the meaning of the vision, the men that Cornelius sent to Peter arrive at the house where Peter is staying"
"  Peter is instructed to go with them,[Acts 10:19] and he does so"
"  This is significant because Peter was a Jew, and it was against the Jewish law for Jews to associate with Gentiles"
"[Acts 10:29] And so, what the text seems to be saying is that the vision Peter received about eating unclean animals was actually about the message of the Gospel and how it was for everyone, even ""unclean"" Gentiles"
  The text appears to report Peter himself as recognizing this
"  After Cornelius tells Peter of the vision that he received, and how he sent men to find Peter as a result of the angel's message to him, Peter exclaims: ""I truly understand that God shows no partiality, but in every nation anyone who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him"
"""[Acts 10:34–35]"
"Christian vegetarians and vegans, in other words, tend to say that this passage is not about which animals one may or may not eat, but it is about who the Gospel is for, as Laura Hobgood-Oster puts it:"
"The vision, it seems, is not about eating animals; rather it is about extending hospitality to all humans"
"  While animals in sacred texts are often real animals and should be considered as such, in this particular case it seems that in Peter’s vision animals symbolized human categories that exclude other humans from community"
"Sarah Withrow King writes that God uses this vision to remind Peter that he is to ""remove barriers of fellowship and to reconcile with those from whom we have been separated in order to further the reign of God on earth"
" the vision is one of radical inclusion"""
" This interpretation is supported by (1) noting that there is no better way to get the attention of a hungry person than to use a vision involving food, and (2) there is no mention in the passage of what food is actually served, so we cannot assume that the vision is telling Peter that he must eat the unclean food when he visits Cornelius's house"
John Vujicic agrees with the interpretation above and supports it with two further observations
"  First, he notes that after receiving the vision, Peter did not eat anything"
"  But, Vujicic writes, ""In the sheet were also so called CLEAN animals"
 Peter could have at least selected some sheep or cattle and killed but he didn’t
""" Second, according to Vujicic, the reason Peter didn't simply take up and eat a clean animal was because Peter was in fact a vegetarian"
  Peter is reported as describing himself as a vegetarian in the Clementine Homilies
" This last point will be unconvincing to many Christians, because the Clementine Homilies are not canonical literature"
"In Mark 7:14–15, Jesus says the following: ""'Listen to me, all of you, and understand: there is nothing outside a person that by going in can defile, but the things that come out are what defile"
"  His disciples fail to understand, so once they are alone with Jesus, they ask him about it, and Jesus elaborates as follows: ""Do you not see that whatever goes into a person from outside cannot defile, since it enters, not the heart but the stomach, and goes out into the sewer? "
 It is what comes out of a person that defiles
"  For it is from within, from the human heart, that evil intentions come"
"""[Mark 7:18–21] In the middle of this speech, the author of the Gospel of Mark writes explicitly that in saying these things, Jesus ""declared all foods clean"""
"In this passage, Jesus is teaching that his followers do not need to obey the Jewish dietary laws"
"  The context also makes clear that Jesus's focus is on the status of the human heart, which he sees as the source of evil intentions, and not the mere observing of rules"
"  In the opening verses of Mark chapter 7, Jesus is challenged by the ""Pharisees and scribes"" who ""live according to the tradition of the elders"""
[Mark 7:5–6] Jesus's reply is that following religious rules and traditions is often done as a way of avoiding following God and God's commandments
"[Mark 7:9] Jesus's teaching that all foods were now clean was a continuation of this: what matters is the human heart, not external observance to religious rules"
"Some Christians and Christian groups suggest that Jesus's teaching in Mark 7 demonstrates that Christians can eat whatever they want, that dietary choices are a matter of ""Christian liberty"", and that therefore vegetarianism or veganism could never be obligatory for Christians"
"Christian vegetarians and vegans counter, however, that the point of Jesus's teaching in Mark 7 is that his followers should concern themselves with the status of their heart which ""informs our relationship with God, with each other, and the world"""
" At most, we could deduce that when Jesus declared all foods clean, he was implicitly accepting the permissibility for his immediate audience of eating the meat that was available to them in Israel in the first-century"
  But it doesn't follow from this that all Christians everywhere can eat whatever they like
"Christian vegetarians and vegans might make the point described above in the discussion of Luke 24, namely, that few Christians in the West think it is okay to eat cats, dogs, or foods such as foie gras"
"  If, however, it is morally problematic to eat cats, dogs or foie gras, then Jesus's declaring all foods clean doesn't make eating animals purely a matter of ""Christian liberty"", if by that is meant that each person can decide for him- or herself what to eat"
  Quite the opposite appears to be true
"  If Jesus's point in this passage was that the source of human evil comes from the intentions within the human heart, then Jesus's followers should seek to avoid behaviors and practices which involve intentionally inflicting cruelty on the non-human animals that God has created"
"Vegetarianism appears to have been a point of contention within some early Christian circles, notably in Rome"
" Within the Bible's New Testament, the Apostle Paul states that people of ""weak faith"" ""eat only vegetables"",[Romans 14:1–4] although he also warns both meat-eaters and vegetarians to ""stop passing judgment on one another"" when it comes to food in verse 13 and ""[It is] good neither to eat flesh"" in verse 21"
" Paul also said, ""The Spirit clearly says that in later times some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons"
" Such teachings come through hypocritical liars, whose consciences have been seared as with a hot iron"
" They […] order […] to abstain from certain foods"""
"[1Timothy 4:1–3] According to the Christian Vegetarian Association, Paul was not referring to vegetarianism, which they say was not an issue in those times, but to the practice of not eating meat from the meat market because of fear that (like the above issue involving Daniel) it was sacrificed to an idol"
"[1Corinthians 10:19–29] ""Wherefore, if meat [brōma, Strong's #1033, 'anything used as food'] make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to offend"
"""1Corinthians 8:13"
In the 4th Century some Jewish Christian groups maintained that Jesus was himself a vegetarian
 Epiphanius quotes the Gospel of the Ebionites where Jesus has a confrontation with the high priest
" Jesus chastises the leadership saying, ""I am come to end the sacrifices and feasts of blood; and if ye cease not offering and eating of flesh and blood, the wrath of God shall not cease from you; even as it came to your fathers in the wilderness, who lusted for flesh, and did sate to their content, and were filled with rottenness, and the plague consumed them"
"According to Lightfoot, ""the Christianized Essennes […] condemned the slaughter of victims on grounds very different from those alleged in the Epistle of Hebrews, not because they have been superseded by the Atonement, but because they are in their very nature repulsive to God; not because they have ceased to be right, but because they never were right from the beginning"""
"Other early Christian historical documents observe that many influential Christians during the formative centuries of Christianity were vegetarian, though certainly not all"
" The Clementine homilies, a second-century work purportedly based on the teachings of the Apostle Peter, states, ""The unnatural eating of flesh meats is as polluting as the heathen worship of devils, with its sacrifices and its impure feasts, through participation in it a man becomes a fellow eater with devils"
"""[citation needed]"
"Although early Christian vegetarianism appears to have been downplayed in favor of more ""modern"" Christian culture, the practice of vegetarianism appears to have been very widespread in early Christianity, both in the leadership and among the laity"
 Origen's work Contra Celsum quotes Celsus commenting vegetarian practices among  Christians he had contact with
" Although not vegetarian himself and vehemently against the idea that Christians must be vegetarians, Augustine nevertheless wrote that those Christians who ""abstain both from flesh and from wine"" are ""without number"""
The Bible Christian Church founded by Reverend William Cowherd in 1809 followed a vegetarian diet
 Cowherd was one of the philosophical forerunners of the Vegetarian Society
 Cowherd encouraged members to abstain from eating of meat as a form of temperance
" Cowherd emphasized that vegetarianism was good for health, whilst eating meat was unnatural and likely to cause aggression"
" Later he is reputed to have said ""If God had meant us to eat meat, then it would have come to us in edible form [as is the ripened fruit]"

"During Lent some Christian communities, such as Orthodox Christians in the Middle East, undertake partial fasting eating only one light meal per day"
" For strict Greek Orthodox Christians and Copts, all meals during this 40-day period are prepared without animal products and are essentially vegan"
" Unlike veganism, however, abstaining from animal products during Lent is intended to be only temporary and not a permanent way of life"
"Eastern Orthodox laity traditionally abstains from animal products on Wednesdays (because, according to Christian tradition, Judas betrayed Jesus on the Wednesday prior to the Crucifixion of Jesus) and Fridays (because Jesus is thought to have been crucified on the subsequent Friday), as well as during the four major fasting periods of the year: Great Lent, the Apostles' Fast, the Dormition Fast and the Nativity Fast"
" Catholic laity traditionally abstain from animal flesh on Fridays and through the Lenten season leading up to Easter (sometimes being required to do so by law, see fasting and abstinence in the Roman Catholic Church), some also, as a matter of private piety, observe Wednesday abstinence"
" Fish is not considered proper meat in any case (see pescetarianism, though the Eastern Orthodox allow fish only on days on which the fasting is lessened but meat still not allowed)"

"According to Canon Law, Roman Catholics are required to abstain from meat (defined as all animal flesh and organs, excluding water animals) on Ash Wednesday and all Fridays of Lent including Good Friday"
" Ash Wednesday and Good Friday are also fast days for Catholics ages 18 to 60, in which one main meal and two half-meals are eaten, with no snacking"
" Canon Law also obliges Catholics to abstain from meat on the Fridays of the year outside of Lent (excluding certain holy days) unless, with the permission of the local conference of bishops, another penitential act is substituted"
 Exceptions are allowed for health and necessity like manual labor and not causing offense when being a guest
 The restrictions on eating meat on these days is solely as an act of penance and not because of a religious objection to eating meat

"The earliest records of vegetarianism as a concept and practice amongst a significant number of people are from ancient India, especially among the Hindus and Jains"
 Later records indicate that small groups within the ancient Greek civilizations in southern Italy and Greece also adopted some dietary habits similar to vegetarianism
" In both instances, the diet was closely connected with the idea of nonviolence toward animals (called ahimsa in India), and was promoted by religious groups and philosophers"
"Following the Christianization of the Roman Empire in late antiquity (4th–6th centuries), vegetarianism nearly disappeared from Europe"
" Several orders of monks in medieval Europe restricted or banned the consumption of meat for ascetic reasons, but none of them abstained from the consumption of fish; these monks were not vegetarians, but some were pescetarians"

" People do not killany living creatures, do not keep pigs and fowl,and do not sell live cattle"
"—Faxian, 4th/5th century CEChinese pilgrim to India"
Jain and Buddhist sources show that the principle of nonviolence toward animals was an established rule in both religions as early as the 6th century BCE
" The Jain concept, which is particularly strict, may be even older"
" Parshva, the earliest Jain leader (Tirthankara) whom modern historians consider to be a historical figure, lived in the 8th or 7th century BCE"
 He is said to have preached nonviolence no less radically than it was practiced in the Jain community in the times of Mahavira (6th century BCE)
" Between 4th and 1st centuries BCE, or perhaps as late as 5th century CE, ancient Indian philosopher Valluvar wrote an exclusive chapter on veganism or moral vegetarianism in his work Tirukkural, emphasizing unambiguously on non-animal diet (Chapter 26), non-harming (Chapter 32), and non-killing (Chapter 33)"
Not everyone who refused to participate in any killing or injuring of animals also abstained from the consumption of meat
 Hence the question of Buddhist vegetarianism in the earliest stages of that religion's development is controversial
 There are two schools of thought
 One says that the Buddha and his followers ate meat offered to them by hosts or alms-givers if they had no reason to suspect that the animal had been slaughtered specifically for their sake
" The other one says that the Buddha and his community of monks (sangha) were strict vegetarians and the habit of accepting alms of meat was only tolerated later on, after a decline of discipline"
"The first opinion is supported by several passages in the Pali version of the Tripitaka, the opposite one by some Mahayana texts"
 All those sources were put into writing several centuries after the death of the Buddha
 They may reflect the conflicting positions of different wings or currents within the Buddhist community in its early stage
" According to the Vinaya Pitaka, the first schism happened when the Buddha was still alive: a group of monks led by Devadatta left the community because they wanted stricter rules, including an unconditional ban on meat eating"
"The Mahaparinibbana Sutta, which narrates the end of the Buddha's life, states that he died after eating sukara-maddava, a term translated by some as pork, by others as mushrooms (or an unknown vegetable)"
"The Buddhist emperor Ashoka (304–232 BCE) was a vegetarian, and a determined promoter of nonviolence to animals"
" He promulgated detailed laws aimed at the protection of many species, abolished animal sacrifice at his court, and admonished the population to avoid all kinds of unnecessary killing and injury"
" Ashoka has asserted protection to fauna, from his edicts:"
"Beloved-of-the-Gods, King Piyadasi, has caused this Dhamma edict to be written"
 Here (in my domain) no living beings are to be slaughtered or offered in sacrifice
" Nor should festivals be held, for Beloved-of-the-Gods, King Piyadasi, sees much to object to in such festivals, although there are some festivals that Beloved-of-the-Gods, King Piyadasi, does approve of"
"Formerly, in the kitchen of Beloved-of-the-Gods, King Piyadasi, hundreds of thousands of animals were killed every day to make curry"
" But now with the writing of this Dhamma edict only three creatures, two peacocks and a deer are killed, and the deer not always"
" And in time, not even these three creatures will be killed"
—Edicts of Ashoka on 1st Major Rock Edict
"Twenty-six years after my coronation various animals were declared to be protected—parrots, mainas, aruna, ruddy geese, wild ducks, nandimukhas, gelatas, bats, queen ants, terrapins, boneless fish, vedareyaka, gangapuputaka, sankiya fish, tortoises, porcupines, squirrels, deer, bulls, okapinda, wild asses, wild pigeons, domestic pigeons and all four-footed creatures that are neither useful nor edible"
" Those nanny goats, ewes and sows which are with young or giving milk to their young are protected, and so are young ones less than six months old"
" Cocks are not to be caponized, husks hiding living beings are not to be burnt and forests are not to be burnt either without reason or to kill creatures"

Theravada Buddhists used to observe the regulation of the Pali canon which allowed them to eat meat unless the animal had been slaughtered specifically for them
 In the Mahayana school some scriptures advocated vegetarianism; a particularly uncompromising one was the famous Lankavatara Sutra written in the fourth or fifth century CE
"Philosopher Michael Allen Fox asserts that ""Hinduism has the most profound connection with a vegetarian way of life and the strongest claim to fostering and supporting it"
""" In the ancient Vedic period (between 1500 and 500 BCE), although the laws allowed the consumption of some kinds of meat, vegetarianism was encouraged"
" Hinduism yields several foundations for vegetarianism as the Vedas, the oldest and sacred texts of Hinduism, assert that all creatures manifest the same life force and therefore merit equal care and compassion"
 A number of Hindu texts place injunctions against meat eating and others like the Ramayana and Mahabharata advocate for a vegetarian diet
" In Hinduism, killing a cow is traditionally considered a sin"
"Vegetarianism was, and still is, mandatory for Hindu yogis, both for the practitioners of Hatha Yoga and for the disciples of the Vaishnava schools of Bhakti Yoga (especially the Gaudiya Vaishnavas)"
 A bhakta (devotee) offers all his food to Vishnu or Krishna as prasad before eating it

Shankar Narayan suggests that the origin of vegetarianism in India developed from the idea that balance needed to be restored
" He claims, ""Along with the development in civilisation, savagery also increased and those who were helpless and voiceless among both humans and non-human animals were more and more exploited and killed to satiate human needs and greed thus disturbing the balance of nature"
 But there were also many serious attempts to bring back the humanity to sanity and restore balance from time to time
""" He also says that the idea of living in harmony with nature became central to the rulers and kings"
"A small number of Jewish scholars throughout history have argued that the Torah provides a scriptural basis for vegetarianism, now or in the Messianic Age"
 Some writers assert that the Jewish prophet Isaiah was a vegetarian
" A number of ancient Jewish sects, including early Karaite sects, regarded the eating of meat as prohibited, at least while Israel was in exile, and medieval scholars such as Joseph Albo and Isaac Arama regarded vegetarianism as a moral ideal, out of a concern for the moral character of the slaughterer"
In Greece during classical antiquity the vegetarian diet was called abstinence from beings with a soul (Greek ἀποχὴ ἐμψύχων)
 As a principle or deliberate way of life it was always limited to a rather small number of practitioners belonging to specific philosophical schools or certain religious groups
"The earliest European/Asian Minor references to a vegetarian diet occur in Homer (Odyssey 9, 82–104) and Herodotus (4, 177), who mention the Lotophagi (Lotus-eaters), an indigenous people on the North African coast, who according to Herodotus lived on nothing but the fruits of a plant called lotus"
" Diodorus Siculus (3, 23–24) transmits tales of vegetarian peoples or tribes in Ethiopia, and further stories of this kind are narrated and discussed in ancient sources"
The earliest reliable evidence for vegetarian theory and practice in Greece dates from the 6th century BC
" The Orphics, a religious movement spreading in Greece at that time may have practiced vegetarianism"
 It is unclear whether the Greek religious teacher Pythagoras actually advocated vegetarianism and it is more likely that Pythagoras only prohibited certain kinds of meat
 Later writers presented Pythagoras as prohibiting meat altogether
" Eudoxus of Cnidus, a student of Archytas and Plato, writes that ""Pythagoras was distinguished by such purity and so avoided killing and killers that he not only abstained from animal foods, but even kept his distance from cooks and hunters"""
"The followers of Pythagoras (called Pythagoreans) did not always practice strict vegetarianism, but at least their inner circle did"
" For the general public, abstention from meat was a hallmark of the so-called ""Pythagorean way of life"""
 Both Orphics and strict Pythagoreans also avoided eggs and shunned the ritual offerings of meat to the gods which were an essential part of traditional religious sacrifice
 In the 5th century BC the philosopher Empedocles distinguished himself as a radical advocate of vegetarianism specifically and of respect for animals in general
" A fictionalized portrayal of Pythagoras appears in Book XV of Ovid's Metamorphoses, in which he advocates a form of strict vegetarianism"
" It was through this portrayal that Pythagoras was best known to English-speakers throughout the early modern period and, prior to the coinage of the word ""vegetarianism"", vegetarians were referred to in English as ""Pythagoreans"""
"The question of whether there are any ethical duties toward animals was hotly debated, and the arguments in dispute were quite similar to the ones familiar in modern discussions on animal rights"
 Vegetarianism was usually part and parcel of religious convictions connected with the concept of transmigration of the soul (metempsychosis)
" There was a widely held belief, popular among both vegetarians and non-vegetarians, that in the Golden Age of the beginning of humanity mankind was strictly non-violent"
" In that utopian state of the world hunting, livestock breeding, and meat-eating, as well as agriculture were unknown and unnecessary, as the earth spontaneously produced in abundance all the food its inhabitants needed"
 This myth is recorded by Hesiod (Works and Days 109sqq
"), Plato (Statesman 271–2), the famous Roman poet Ovid (Metamorphoses 1,89sqq"
" Ovid also praised the Pythagorean ideal of universal nonviolence (Metamorphoses 15,72sqq"
Almost all the Stoics were emphatically anti-vegetarian (with the prominent exception of Seneca)
" They insisted on the absence of reason in brutes, leading them to conclude that there cannot be any ethical obligations or restraints in dealing with the world of irrational animals"
" As for the followers of the Cynic School, their extremely frugal way of life entailed a practically meatless diet, but they did not make vegetarianism their maxim"
In the Platonic Academy the scholarchs (school heads) Xenocrates and (probably) Polemon pleaded for vegetarianism
" In the Peripatetic school Theophrastus, Aristotle's immediate successor, supported it"
 Some of the prominent Platonists and Neo-Platonists in the age of the Roman Empire lived on a vegetarian diet
" These included Apollonius of Tyana, Plotinus, and Porphyry"
" Porphyry wrote a treatise On abstinence from beings with a soul, the most elaborate ancient pro-vegetarian text known to us"
"Among the Manicheans, a major religious movement founded in the third century AD, there was an elite group called Electi (the chosen) who were Lacto-Vegetarians for ethical reasons and abided by a commandment which strictly banned killing"
 Common Manicheans called Auditores (Hearers) obeyed looser rules of nonviolence
"The religions of Chinese Buddhism and Taoism require that monks and nuns eat an egg free, onion free vegetarian diet"
" Since abbeys were usually self-sufficient, in practice, this meant they ate a vegan diet"
 Many religious orders also avoid hurting plant life by avoiding root vegetables
" This is not just seen as an ascetic practice, but Chinese spirituality generally believes that animals have immortal souls, and that a diet of mostly grain is the healthiest for humans"
"In Chinese folk religions, as well as the aforementioned faiths, people often eat vegan on the 1st and 15th of the month, as well as the eve of Chinese New Year"
 Some nonreligious people do this as well
 This is similar to the Christian practice of lent and not eating meat on Friday
" The percentage of people permanently being pure vegetarian is about the same as the modern English-speaking world, but this percentage has not really changed for a very long time"
 Many people eat vegan for a certain amount of time in order to make up for the belief that they have sinned

" Subsequently, in the year 737 of the Nara period, the Emperor Seimu approved the eating of fish and shellfish"
" During the twelve hundred years from the Nara period to the Meiji Restoration in the latter half of the 19th century, Japanese people enjoyed vegetarian-style meals"
 They usually ate rice as a staple food as well as beans and vegetables
 It was only on special occasions or celebrations that fish was served
" Over this period, the Japanese people (particularly Buddhist monks) developed a vegetarian cuisine called shōjin-ryōri which was native to Japan"

"In 1872 of the Meiji restoration, as part of the opening up of Japan to Western influence, Emperor Meiji lifted the ban on the consumption of red meat"
"  The removal of the ban encountered resistance and in one notable response, ten monks attempted to break into the Imperial Palace"
"  The monks asserted that due to foreign influence, large numbers of Japanese had begun eating meat and that this was ""destroying the soul of the Japanese people"
"""  Several of the monks were killed during the break-in attempt, and the remainder were arrested"
"In Greek-Orthodox Christianity (Greece, Cyprus, Russia, Serbia and other Orthodox countries), adherents eat a diet completely free of animal products for fasting periods (except for honey) as well as all types of oil and alcohol, during a strict fasting period"
" The Ethiopian Orthodox Church prescribes a number of fasting (tsom, Ge'ez: ጾም ṣōm, excluding any kind of animal products, including dairy products and eggs) periods, including Wednesdays, Fridays, and the entire Lenten season, so Ethiopian cuisine contains many dishes that are vegan"
"The leaders of the early Christians in the apostolic era (James, Peter, and John) were concerned that eating food sacrificed to idols might result in ritual pollution"

In late antiquity and in the Middle Ages many monks and hermits renounced meat-eating in the context of their asceticism
" The most prominent of them was St Jerome († 419), whom they used to take as their model"
" The Rule of St Benedict (6th century) allowed the Benedictines to eat fish and fowl, but forbade the consumption of the meat of quadrupeds unless the religious was ill"
" Many other rules of religious orders contained similar restrictions of diet, some of which even included fowl, but fish was never prohibited, as Jesus himself had eaten fish (Luke 24:42-43)"
" The concern of those monks and nuns was frugality, voluntary privation, and self-mortification"
 William of Malmesbury writes that Bishop Wulfstan of Worcester (d
 1095) decided to adhere to a strict vegetarian diet simply because he found it difficult to resist the smell of roasted goose
" Saint Genevieve, the Patron Saint of Paris, is mentioned as having observed a vegetarian diet—but as an act of physical austerity, rather than out of concern for animals"
" Medieval hermits, at least those portrayed in literature, may have been vegetarians for similar reasons, as suggested in a passage from Sir Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur: 'Then departed Gawain and Ector as heavy (sad) as they might for their misadventure, and so rode till that they came to the rough mountain, and there they tied their horses and went on foot to the hermitage"
" And when they were come up, they saw a poor house, and beside the chapel a little courtelage, where Nacien the hermit gathered worts, as he which had tasted none other meat of a great while"
John Passmore claimed that there was no surviving textual evidence for ethically motivated vegetarianism in either ancient and medieval Catholicism or in the Eastern Churches

" Medieval Paulician Adoptionists, such as the Bogomils (""Friends of God"") of the Thrace area in Bulgaria and the Christian dualist Cathars, also despised the consumption of meat"
It was during the European Renaissance that vegetarianism reemerged in Europe as a philosophical concept based on an ethical motivation
 Among the first celebrities who supported it were Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519) and Pierre Gassendi (1592–1655)
 In the 17th century the paramount theorist of the meatless or Pythagorean diet was the English writer Thomas Tryon (1634–1703) and subsequently the Romantic poets
" On the other hand, influential philosophers such as René Descartes (1596–1650) and Immanuel Kant (1724–1804) were of the opinion that there cannot be any ethical duties whatsoever toward animals—though Kant also observes that ""He who is cruel to animals becomes hard also in his dealings with men"
 We can judge the heart of a man by his treatment of animals
""" By the end of the 18th century in England the claim that animals were made only for man's use (anthropocentrism) was still being advanced, but no longer carried general assent"
" Very soon, it would disappear altogether"
"In the United States, there were small groups of Christian vegetarians in the 18th century"
" The best known of them was Ephrata Cloister in Pennsylvania, a religious community founded by Conrad Beissel in 1732"

" It was propagated as an essential part of ""the natural way of life"
""" Some of its champions sharply criticized the civilization of their age and strove to improve public health"
"During the Age of Enlightenment and in the early nineteenth century, England was the place where vegetarian ideas were more welcome than anywhere else      Europe, and the English vegetarians were particularly enthusiastic about the practical implementation of their principles"

" As the movement spread across the country, more working-class people began to identify as vegetarians, though still a small number in comparison to the number of meat eaters"
" Groups were established all across England, but the movement failed to gain popular support and was drowned out by other, more exciting, struggles of the late-nineteenth century"
"In 1802, Joseph Ritson authored An Essay on Abstinence from Animal Food, as a Moral Duty"

The first Vegetarian Society of the modern western world was established in England in 1847
 The Society was founded by the 140 participants of a conference at Ramsgate and by 1853 had 889 members
" By the end of the century, the group had attracted almost 4,000 members"
" After its first year, alone, the group grew to 265 members that ranged from ages 14 to 76"
 English vegetarians were a small but highly motivated and active group

" Not all members of the Vegetarian Society were ""Cowherdites"", though they constituted about half of the group"
"The Cornishman newspaper reported in March 1880 that a vegetarian restaurant had existed in Manchester for some years and one had just opened in Oxford Street, London"
Class played prominent roles in the Victorian vegetarian movement
 There was somewhat of a disconnect when the upper-middle class attempted to reach out to the working and lower classes
" Though the meat industry was growing substantially, many working class Britons had mostly vegetarian diets out of necessity rather than out of the desire to improve their health and morals"
 The working class did not have the luxury being able to choose what they would eat and they believed that a mixed diet was a valuable source of energy
"Tied closely with other social reform movements, women were especially visible as the ""mascot"""
" When late-Victorians sought to promote their cause in journal, female angels or healthy English women were the images most commonly depicted"
" Two prominent female vegetarians were Elizabeth Horsell, author of a vegetarian cookbook and a lecturer (and wife of William Horsell), and Jane Hurlstone"
" Hurlstone was active in Owenism, animal welfare, and Italian nationalism as well"
" Though women were regularly overshadowed by men, noted the newspaper the Vegetarian Advocate, that women were more inclined to do work in support of vegetarianism and animal welfare than men, who tended to only speak on the matter"
" In a domestic setting, women promoted vegetarianism though cooking vegetarian dishes for public dinners and arranging entertainment that promoted the cause"

" Of the 26 vegetarian cookbooks published during the Victorian Age, 14 were written by women"
"In 1895, The Women's Vegetarian Union was established by Alexandrine Veigele, a French woman living in London"
 The organization aimed to promote a 'purer and simpler' diet and they regularly reached out to the working class
The morality arguments behind vegetarianism in Victorian England drew idealists from various causes together
" Specifically, many vegetarian women identified as feminists"
" In her feminist utopia, Herland (1915), Charlotte Perkins Gilman imagined a vegetarian society"
" Margaret Fuller also advocated for vegetarianism in her work, Women of the Nineteenth Century (1845)"
" She argued that when women are liberated from domestic life, they would help transform the violent male society, and vegetarianism would become the dominant diet"
" Frances Power Cobbe, a co-founder of the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection, identified as a vegetarian and was a well-known activist for feminism"

The Indian concept of nonviolence had a growing impact in the Western world
" The model of Mahatma Gandhi, a strong and uncompromising advocate of nonviolence toward animals, contributed to the popularization of vegetarianism in Western countries"
" The study of Far-Eastern religious and philosophical concepts of nonviolence was also instrumental in the shaping of Albert Schweitzer's principle of ""reverence for life"", which is still today a common argument in discussions on ethical aspects of diet"
 But Schweitzer himself started to practise vegetarianism only shortly before his death

"In August 1944, several members of the British Vegetarian Society asked that a section of its newsletter be devoted to non-dairy vegetarianism"
" When the request was turned down, Donald Watson, secretary of the Leicester branch, set up a new quarterly newsletter in November 1944 called it The Vegan News"
"Dorothy Morgan and Donald Watson, co-founders of the Vegan Society, chose the word vegan themselves, based on ""the first three and last two letters of 'vegetarian'"" because it marked, in Mr Watson's words, ""the beginning and end of vegetarian"""
"Today, Indian vegetarians, who are primarily lacto-vegetarians, are estimated to make up more than 70 percent of the world's vegetarians"

Writers of advocacy histories
"Veganism is the practice of abstaining from the use of animal products, particularly in diet, and an associated philosophy that rejects the commodity status of animals"
[c] An individual who follows the diet or philosophy is known as a vegan
 Distinctions may be made between several categories of veganism
" Dietary vegans, also known as ""strict vegetarians"", refrain from consuming meat, eggs, dairy products, and any other animal-derived substances"
"[d] An ethical vegan, also known as a ""moral vegetarian"", is someone who not only follows a vegan diet but extends the philosophy into other areas of their lives, and opposes the use of animals for any purpose"
"[e] Another term is ""environmental veganism"", which refers to the avoidance of animal products on the premise that the industrial farming of animals is environmentally damaging and unsustainable"
"Well-planned vegan diets are regarded as appropriate for all stages of life, including infancy and pregnancy, by the American Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics,[f] the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council, the British Dietetic Association, Dietitians of Canada, and the New Zealand Ministry of Health"
" The German Society for Nutrition—which is a non-profit organisation and not an official health agency—does not recommend vegan diets for children or adolescents, or during pregnancy and breastfeeding"
"[g] There is inconsistent evidence for vegan diets providing a protective effect against metabolic syndrome, but some evidence suggests that a vegan diet can help with weight loss, especially in the short term"
" Vegan diets tend to be higher in dietary fiber, magnesium, folic acid, vitamin C, vitamin E, iron, and phytochemicals, and lower in dietary energy, saturated fat, cholesterol, omega-3 fatty acid, vitamin D, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12"
"[h] A poorly-planned vegan diet may lead to nutritional deficiencies that nullify any beneficial effects and may cause serious health issues, some of which can only be prevented with fortified foods or dietary supplements"
" Vitamin B12 supplementation is important because its deficiency causes blood disorders and potentially irreversible neurological damage, though this danger is also present in poorly-planned non-vegan diets"
"Dorothy Morgan and Donald Watson coined the term ""vegan"" in 1944 when they co-founded the Vegan Society in the UK"
" At first, they used it to mean ""non-dairy vegetarian"

" The Greek sage Pythagoras may have advocated an early form of strict vegetarianism, but his life is so obscure that it is disputed whether he ever advocated any form of vegetarianism at all"
 He almost certainly prohibited his followers from eating beans and from wearing woolen garments
" Eudoxus of Cnidus, a student of Archytas and Plato, writes that ""Pythagoras was distinguished by such purity and so avoided killing and killers that he not only abstained from animal foods, but even kept his distance from cooks and hunters"""
 One of the earliest known vegans was the Arab poet al-Maʿarri (c
"[b] Their arguments were based on health, the transmigration of souls, animal welfare, and the view—espoused by Porphyry in De Abstinentia ab Esu Animalium (""On Abstinence from Animal Food"", c"
" 270)—that if humans deserve justice, then so do animals"
Vegetarianism established itself as a significant movement in 19th-century Britain and the United States
 A minority of vegetarians avoided animal food entirely
" In 1813, the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley published A Vindication of Natural Diet, advocating ""abstinence from animal food and spirituous liquors"", and in 1815, William Lambe, a London physician, stated that his ""water and vegetable diet"" could cure anything from tuberculosis to acne"

" Sylvester Graham's meatless Graham diet—mostly fruit, vegetables, water, and bread made at home with stoneground flour—became popular as a health remedy in the 1830s in the United States"
 Several vegan communities were established around this time
" In Massachusetts, Amos Bronson Alcott, father of the novelist Louisa May Alcott, opened the Temple School in 1834 and Fruitlands in 1844,[j] and in England, James Pierrepont Greaves founded the Concordium, a vegan community at Alcott House on Ham Common, in 1838"
"In 1843, members of Alcott House created the British and Foreign Society for the Promotion of Humanity and Abstinence from Animal Food, led by Sophia Chichester, a wealthy benefactor of Alcott House"
" Alcott House also helped to establish the UK Vegetarian Society, which held its first meeting in 1847 in Ramsgate, Kent"
 The Medical Times and Gazette in London reported in 1884:
"There are two kinds of Vegetarians—one an extreme form, the members of which eat no animal food products what-so-ever; and a less extreme sect, who do not object to eggs, milk, or fish"
 The Vegetarian Society 
 belongs to the latter more moderate division
"An article in the Society's magazine, the Vegetarian Messenger, in 1851 discussed alternatives to shoe leather, which suggests the presence of vegans within the membership who rejected animal use entirely, not only in diet"
 By the 1886 publication of Henry S
" Salt's A Plea for Vegetarianism and Other Essays, he asserts that, ""It is quite true that most—not all—Food Reformers admit into their diet such animal food as milk, butter, cheese, and eggs"

 The consumption of milk and eggs became a battleground over the following decades
 There were regular discussions about it in the Vegetarian Messenger; it appears from the correspondence pages that many opponents of veganism came from vegetarians
"During a visit to London in 1931, Mahatma Gandhi—who had joined the Vegetarian Society's executive committee when he lived in London from 1888 to 1891—gave a speech to the Society arguing that it ought to promote a meat-free diet as a matter of morality, not health"
 Lacto-vegetarians acknowledged the ethical consistency of the vegan position but regarded a vegan diet as impracticable and were concerned that it might be an impediment to spreading vegetarianism if vegans found themselves unable to participate in social circles where no non-animal food was available
" This became the predominant view of the Vegetarian Society, which in 1935 stated: ""The lacto-vegetarians, on the whole, do not defend the practice of consuming the dairy products except on the ground of expediency"
"In August 1944, several members of the Vegetarian Society asked that a section of its newsletter be devoted to non-dairy vegetarianism"

 He called it The Vegan News

 Veganuary also refers to the month-long challenge itself
" On February 1, 2021, Veganuary released the final figures of their 2021 campaign to reveal record-breaking results"
"  In January 2021, 582,538 people from 209 different countries and territories signed up for the 31-day vegan challenge, exceeding the total of 400,000 who took part in 2020"
" In December 2020, public figures including Paul McCartney, Ricky Gervais, Jane Goodall, John Bishop, Sara Pascoe and over a hundred more celebrities, politicians, businesses and NGOs signed a joint letter calling on people to join the fight against climate change and prevent future pandemics through changing to a plant-based diet, starting with signing-up for Veganuary"
"PETA bunny:certified vegan, no animal testing"
"While vegans broadly abstain from animal products, there are many ways in which animal products are used, and different individuals and organizations that identify with the practice of veganism may use some limited animal products based on philosophy, means or other concerns"
"Philosopher Gary Steiner argues that it is not possible to be entirely vegan, because animal use and products are ""deeply and imperceptibly woven into the fabric of human society"""
Animal Ingredients A to Z (2004) and Veganissimo A to Z (2013) list which ingredients might be animal-derived
" The British Vegan Society's sunflower logo and PETA's bunny logo mean the product is certified vegan, which includes no animal testing"
" The Leaping Bunny logo signals no animal testing, but it might not be vegan"
" The Vegan Society criteria for vegan certification are that the product contain no animal products, and that neither the finished item nor its ingredients have been tested on animals by, or on behalf of, the manufacturer or by anyone over whom the manufacturer has control"
" Its website contains a list of certified products, as does Australia's Choose Cruelty Free (CCF)"
" The British Vegan Society will certify a product only if it is free of animal involvement as far as possible and practical, including animal testing, but ""recognises that it is not always possible to make a choice that avoids the use of animals"", an issue that was highlighted in 2016 when it became known that the UK's newly introduced £5 note contained tallow"
"Like vegetarians vegans do not eat meat (including beef, pork, poultry, fowl, game, animal seafood)"
 The main difference between a vegan and vegetarian diet is that vegans exclude dairy products and eggs
 Ethical vegans avoid them on the premise that their production causes animal suffering and premature death
" In egg production, most male chicks are culled because they do not lay eggs"
" To obtain milk from dairy cattle, cows are made pregnant to induce lactation; they are kept lactating for three to seven years, then slaughtered"
" Female calves can be separated from their mothers within 24 hours of birth, and fed milk replacer to retain the cow's milk for human consumption"
" Most male calves are slaughtered at birth, sent for veal production, or reared for beef"
"Many clothing products may be made of animal products such as silk, wool (including lambswool, shearling, cashmere, angora, mohair, and a number of other fine wools), fur, feathers, pearls, animal-derived dyes, leather, snakeskin, or other kinds of skin or animal product"
" While dietary vegans might use animal products in clothing, toiletries, and similar, ethical veganism extends not only to matters of food but also to the wearing or use of animal products, and rejects the commodification of animals altogether"
:62  Most leather clothing is made from cow skins
" Some vegans regard the purchase of leather, particularly from cows, as financial support for the meat industry"
":115 Vegans may wear clothing items and accessories made of non-animal-derived materials such as hemp, linen, cotton, canvas, polyester, artificial leather (pleather), rubber, and vinyl"
":16 Leather alternatives can come from materials such as cork, piña (from pineapples), cactus, and mushroom leather"
" Some vegan clothes, in particular leather alternatives, are made of petroleum-based products, which has triggered criticism because of the environmental damage involved in their production"
"Vegans replace personal care products and household cleaners containing animal products with products that are vegan, such as vegan dental floss made of bamboo fiber"
 Animal ingredients are ubiquitous because they are relatively inexpensive
" After animals are slaughtered for meat, the leftovers are put through a rendering process and some of that material, particularly the fat, is used in toiletries"
"Common animal-derived ingredients include: tallow in soap; collagen-derived glycerine, which used as a lubricant and humectant in many haircare products, moisturizers, shaving foams, soaps and toothpastes; lanolin from sheep's wool is often found in lip balm and moisturizers; stearic acid is a common ingredient in face creams, shaving foam and shampoos, (as with glycerine, it can be plant-based, but is usually animal-derived); Lactic acid, an alpha-hydroxy acid derived from animal milk, is used in moisturizers; allantoin— from the comfrey plant or cows' urine —is found in shampoos, moisturizers and toothpaste; and carmine from scale insects, such as the female cochineal, is used in food and cosmetics to produce red and pink shades;"
"Beauty Without Cruelty, founded as a charity in 1959, was one of the earliest manufacturers and certifiers of animal-free personal care products"
Vegan groups disagree about insect products
" Neither the Vegan Society nor the American Vegan Society considers honey, silk, and other insect products as suitable for vegans"
" Some vegans believe that exploiting the labor of bees and harvesting their energy source is immoral, and that commercial beekeeping operations can harm and even kill bees"
" Insect products can be defined much more widely, as commercial bees are used to pollinate about 100 different food crops"
"Due to the environmental impact of meat-based pet food and the ethical problems it poses for vegans, some vegans extend their philosophy to include the diets of pets"
" This is particularly true for domesticated cats and dogs, for which vegan pet food is both available and nutritionally complete, such as Vegepet"
" This practice has been met with caution and criticism, especially regarding vegan cat diets because felids are obligate carnivores"
 Nutritionally complete vegan pet diets are comparable to meat-based ones for cats and dogs
 A 2015 study found that 6 out of 24 commercial vegan pet food brands do not meet the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) labeling regulations for amino acid adequacy
"A concern is the case of medications, which are routinely tested on animals to ensure they are effective and safe, and may also contain animal ingredients, such as lactose, gelatine, or stearates"
" There may be no alternatives to prescribed medication or these alternatives may be unsuitable, less effective, or have more adverse side effects"
" Experimentation with laboratory animals is also used for evaluating the safety of vaccines, food additives, cosmetics, household products, workplace chemicals, and many other substances"
" Vegans may avoid certain vaccines, such as the flu vaccine, which is commonly produced in chicken eggs"
" An effective alternative, Flublok, is widely available in the United States"
"Farming of fruits and vegetables may include fertilizing the soil with animal manure – even on organic farms, possibly causing a concern to vegans for ethical or environmental reasons"
" ""Vegan"" (or ""animal-free"") farming uses plant compost only"
"Vegan diets are based on grains and other seeds, legumes (particularly beans), fruits, vegetables, edible mushrooms, and nuts"
"Meatless products made from soybeans (tofu), or wheat-based seitan are sources of plant protein, commonly in the form of vegetarian sausage, mince, and veggie burgers"
 Soy-based dishes are common in vegan diets because soy is a protein source
" They are consumed most often in the form of soy milk and tofu (bean curd), which is soy milk mixed with a coagulant"
" Tofu comes in a variety of textures, depending on water content, from firm, medium firm and extra firm for stews and stir-fries to soft or silken for salad dressings, desserts and shakes"
" Soy is also eaten in the form of tempeh and textured vegetable protein (TVP); also known as textured soy protein (TSP), the latter is often used in pasta sauces"
"Plant milks—such as soy milk, almond milk, cashew milk, grain milks (oat milk, flax milk and rice milk), hemp milk, and coconut milk—are used in place of cows' or goats' milk"
"[l] Soy milk provides around 7 g (¼oz) of protein per cup (240 mL or 8 fl oz), compared with 8 g (2/7oz) of protein per cup of cow's milk"
" Almond milk is lower in dietary energy, carbohydrates, and protein"
 Soy milk should not be used as a replacement for breast milk for babies
" Babies who are not breastfed may be fed commercial infant formula, normally based on cows' milk or soy"
 The latter is known as soy-based infant formula or SBIF
Butter and margarine can be replaced with alternate vegan products
" Vegan cheeses are made from seeds, such as sesame and sunflower; nuts, such as cashew, pine nut, and almond; and soybeans, coconut oil, nutritional yeast, tapioca, and rice, among other ingredients; and can replicate the meltability of dairy cheese"
 Nutritional yeast is a common substitute for the taste of cheese in vegan recipes
" Cheese substitutes can be made at home, including from nuts, such as cashews"
 Yoghurt and cream products can be replaced with plant-based products such as soy yoghurt
"Various types of plant cream have been created to replace dairy cream, and some types of imitation whipped cream are non-dairy"
"In the 2010s and 2020s, a number of companies have genetically engineered yeast to produce cow milk proteins, whey, or fat, without the use of cows"
" These include Perfect Day, Novacca, Motif FoodWorks, Remilk, Final Foods, Imagindairy, Nourish Ingredients, and Circe"
"As of 2019 in the United States, there were numerous vegan egg substitutes available, including products used for ""scrambled"" eggs, cakes, cookies, and doughnuts"
" Baking powder, silken (soft) tofu, mashed potato, bananas, flaxseeds, and aquafaba from chickpeas can also be used as egg substitutes"
"Raw veganism, combining veganism and raw foodism, excludes all animal products and food cooked above 48 °C (118 °F)"
" A raw vegan diet includes vegetables, fruits, nuts, grain and legume sprouts, seeds, and sea vegetables"
" There are many variations of the diet, including fruitarianism"
"American Dietetic Association stated that ""plant-based eating is recognized as not only nutritionally sufficient but also as a way to reduce the risk for many chronic illnesses"""
" Similarly, insurance group Kaiser Permanente, the American Institute for Cancer Research and the US-based Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics state that vegan diets may reduce the risk of certain health conditions, such as cancer"
The reduction in cancer risk may stem from the fact that vegans do not eat processed meat or red meat
" In 2015, the International Agency for Research on Cancer of the World Health Organization (WHO) classified processed meat (bacon, ham, hot dogs, sausages) as carcinogenic to humans (Group 1) and red meat as ""probably carcinogenic"" (Group 2A) to humans"
There is inconsistent evidence for vegan diets providing a protective effect against metabolic syndrome
" Vegan diets appear to help weight loss, especially in the short term"
 There is some tentative evidence of an association between vegan diets and a reduced risk of cancer
 A vegan diet offers no benefit over other types of healthy diet in helping with high blood pressure
"However, eliminating all animal products increases the risk of deficiencies of vitamins B12 and D, calcium, and omega-3 fatty acids"
 Vitamin B12 deficiency occurs in up to 80% of vegans that do not supplement with vitamin B12
 Vegans are at risk of low bone mineral density without supplements
 (see section Critical nutrients)
"Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and Dietitians of Canada state that properly planned vegan diets are appropriate for all life stages, including pregnancy and lactation"
" The Australian National Health and Medical Research Council similarly recognizes a well-planned vegan diet as viable for any age, as does the New Zealand Ministry of Health, British National Health Service, British Nutrition Foundation, Dietitians Association of Australia, United States Department of Agriculture, Mayo Clinic, Canadian Pediatric Society, and Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada"
"The German Society for Nutrition does not recommend a vegan diet for babies, children and adolescents, or for pregnancy or breastfeeding"
"The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and Dietitians of Canada consider well-planned vegetarian and vegan diets ""appropriate for individuals during all stages of the lifecycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes"""
" The German Society for Nutrition cautioned against a vegan diet for pregnant women, breastfeeding women, babies, children, and adolescents"
" The position of the Canadian Pediatric Society is that ""well-planned vegetarian and vegan diets with appropriate attention to specific nutrient components can provide a healthy alternative lifestyle at all stages of fetal, infant, child and adolescent growth"
" It is recommended that attention should be given to nutrient intake, particularly protein, vitamins B12 and D, essential fatty acids, iron, zinc, and calcium"
"The American Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics states that special attention may be necessary to ensure that a vegan diet will provide adequate amounts of vitamin B12, omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin D, calcium, iodine, iron, and zinc"
" These nutrients are available in plant foods, with the exception of vitamin B12, which can be obtained only from B12-fortified vegan foods or supplements"
" Iodine may also require supplementation, such as using iodized salt"
"Vitamin B12 is a bacterial product needed for cell division, the formation and maturation of red blood cells, the synthesis of DNA, and normal nerve function"
" A deficiency may cause megaloblastic anaemia and neurological damage, and, if untreated, may lead to death"
"[m] The high content of folacin in vegetarian diets may mask the hematological symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency, so it may go undetected until neurological signs in the late stages are evident, which can be irreversible, such as neuropsychiatric abnormalities, neuropathy, dementia and, occasionally, atrophy of the optic nerves"
"Vegans sometimes fail to obtain enough B12 from their diet because among non-fortified foods, only those of animal origin contain sufficient amounts"
"[n] Vegetarians are also at risk, as are older people and those with certain medical conditions"
" A 2013 study found that ""[v]egans should take preventive measures to ensure adequate intake of this vitamin, including regular consumption of supplements containing B12"
"Iodine supplementation may be necessary for vegans in countries where salt is not typically iodized, where it is iodized at low levels, or where, as in Britain and Ireland, dairy products are relied upon for iodine delivery because of low levels in the soil"
" Iodine can be obtained from most vegan multivitamins or regular consumption of seaweeds, such as kelp"
"Calcium is needed to maintain bone health and for several metabolic functions, including muscle function, vascular contraction and vasodilation, nerve transmission, intracellular signalling, and hormonal secretion"
 Ninety-nine percent of the body's calcium is stored in the bones and teeth
":35–74 High-calcium foods may include fortified plant milk, kale, collards and raw garlic as common vegetable sources"
"A 2007 report based on the Oxford cohort of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition, which began in 1993, suggested that vegans have an increased risk of bone fractures over meat eaters and vegetarians, likely because of lower dietary calcium intake"
 The study found that vegans consuming at least 525 mg of calcium daily have a risk of fractures similar to that of other groups
"[p] A 2009 study found the bone mineral density (BMD) of vegans was 94 percent that of omnivores, but deemed the difference clinically insignificant"
Varied intake of plant foods can meet human health needs for protein and amino acids
" The American Dietetic Association said in 2009 that a variety of plant foods consumed over the course of a day can provide all the essential amino acids for healthy adults, which means that protein combining in the same meal is generally not necessary"
"Foods high in protein in a vegan diet include legumes (such as beans and lentils), nuts, seeds, and grains (such as oats, wheat, and quinoa)"
"Vitamin D (calciferol) is needed for several functions, including calcium absorption, enabling mineralization of bone, and bone growth"
 Without it bones can become thin and brittle; together with calcium it offers protection against osteoporosis
 Vitamin D is produced in the body when ultraviolet rays from the sun hit the skin; outdoor exposure is needed because UVB radiation does not penetrate glass
" It is present in salmon, tuna, mackerel and cod liver oil, with small amounts in cheese, egg yolks, and beef liver, and in some mushrooms"
Most vegan diets contain little or no vitamin D without fortified food
 People with little sun exposure may need supplements
" The extent to which sun exposure is sufficient depends on the season, time of day, cloud and smog cover, skin melanin content, and whether sunscreen is worn"
" According to the National Institutes of Health, most people can obtain and store sufficient vitamin D from sunlight in the spring, summer, and fall, even in the far north"
" They report that some researchers recommend 5–30 minutes of sun exposure without sunscreen between 10 am and 3 pm, at least twice a week"
" Tanning beds emitting 2–6% UVB radiation have a similar effect, though tanning is inadvisable"
"Due to the lower bioavailability of iron from plant sources, the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy of Sciences established a separate RDA for vegetarians and vegans of 14 mg (¼gr) for vegetarian men and postmenopausal women, and 33 mg (½gr) for premenopausal women not using oral contraceptives"
"High-iron vegan foods include soybeans, blackstrap molasses, black beans, lentils, chickpeas, spinach, tempeh, tofu, and lima beans"
" Iron absorption can be enhanced by eating a source of vitamin C at the same time, such as half a cup of cauliflower or five fluid ounces of orange juice"
" Coffee and some herbal teas can inhibit iron absorption, as can spices that contain tannins such as turmeric, coriander, chiles, and tamarind"
"Alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), an omega-3 fatty acid, is found in walnuts, seeds, and vegetable oils, such as canola and flaxseed oil"
" EPA and DHA, the other primary omega-3 fatty acids, are found only in animal products and algae"
"Ethical veganism, also known as moral vegetarianism, is based on opposition to speciesism, the assignment of value to individuals on the basis of (animal) species membership alone"
" Divisions within animal rights theory include the utilitarian, protectionist approach, which pursues improved conditions for animals"
" It also pertains to the rights-based abolitionism, which seeks to end human ownership of non-humans, including as pets"
" Abolitionists argue that protectionism serves only to make the public feel that animal use can be morally unproblematic (the ""happy meat"" position)"
"Donald Watson, co-founder of The Vegan Society, stated in response to a question on why he was an ethical vegan, ""If an open-minded, honest person pursues a course long enough, and listens to all the criticisms, and in one's own mind can satisfactorily meet all the criticisms against that idea, sooner or later one's resistance against what one sees as evil tradition has to be discarded"
""" On bloodsports, he has said that ""to kill creatures for fun must be the very dregs,"" and that vivisection and animal experimentation ""is probably the cruelest of all Man's attack on the rest of Creation"
""" He has also stated that ""vegetarianism, whilst being a necessary stepping-stone, between meat eating and veganism, is only a stepping stone"
"Alex Hershaft, co-founder of the Farm Animal Rights Movement and Holocaust survivor, states he ""was always bothered by the idea of hitting a beautiful, living, innocent animal over the head, cutting him up into pieces, then shoving the pieces into [his] mouth,"" and that his experiences in the Nazi Holocaust allowed him ""to empathize with the conditions of animals in factory farms, auction yards, and slaughterhouses"" because he ""knows firsthand what it's like to be treated like a worthless object"
"Law professor Gary Francione, an abolitionist, argues that all sentient beings should have the right not to be treated as property, and that adopting veganism must be the baseline for anyone who believes that non-humans have intrinsic moral value"
"[r]:62 Philosopher Tom Regan, also a rights theorist, argues that animals possess value as ""subjects-of-a-life"", because they have beliefs, desires, memory and the ability to initiate action in pursuit of goals"
" The right of subjects-of-a-life not to be harmed can be overridden by other moral principles, but Regan argues that pleasure, convenience and the economic interests of farmers are not weighty enough"
" Philosopher Peter Singer, a protectionist and utilitarian, argues that there is no moral or logical justification for failing to count animal suffering as a consequence when making decisions, and that killing animals should be rejected unless necessary for survival"
" Despite this, he writes that ""ethical thinking can be sensitive to circumstances"", and that he is ""not too concerned about trivial infractions"""
"An argument proposed by Bruce Friedrich, also a protectionist, holds that strict adherence to veganism harms animals, because it focuses on personal purity, rather than encouraging people to give up whatever animal products they can"
" For Francione, this is similar to arguing that, because human-rights abuses can never be eliminated, we should not defend human rights in situations we control"
" By failing to ask a server whether something contains animal products, we reinforce that the moral rights of animals are a matter of convenience, he argues"
 He concludes from this that the protectionist position fails on its own consequentialist terms
"Philosopher Val Plumwood maintained that ethical veganism is ""subtly human-centred"", an example of what she called ""human/nature dualism"" because it views humanity as separate from the rest of nature"
" Ethical vegans want to admit non-humans into the category that deserves special protection, rather than recognize the ""ecological embeddedness"" of all"
" Plumwood wrote that animal food may be an ""unnecessary evil"" from the perspective of the consumer who ""draws on the whole planet for nutritional needs""—and she strongly opposed factory farming—but for anyone relying on a much smaller ecosystem, it is very difficult or impossible to be vegan"
"Bioethicist Ben Mepham, in his review of Francione and Garner's book The Animal Rights Debate: Abolition or Regulation?, concludes that ""if the aim of ethics is to choose the right, or best, course of action in specific circumstances 'all things considered', it is arguable that adherence to such an absolutist agenda is simplistic and open to serious self-contradictions"
" Or, as Farlie puts it, with characteristic panache: 'to conclude that veganism is the ""only ethical response"" is to take a big leap into a very muddy pond'"
""" He cites as examples the adverse effects on animal wildlife derived from the agricultural practices necessary to sustain most vegan diets and the ethical contradiction of favoring the welfare of domesticated animals but not that of wild animals; the imbalance between the resources that are used to promote the welfare of animals as opposed to those destined to alleviate the suffering of the approximately one billion human beings who undergo malnutrition, abuse, and exploitation; the focus on attitudes and conditions in western developed countries, leaving out the rights and interests of societies whose economy, culture and, in some cases, survival rely on a symbiotic relationship with animals"
"David Pearce, a transhumanist philosopher, has argued that humanity has a ""hedonistic imperative"" to not merely avoid cruelty to animals or abolish the ownership of non-human animals, but also to redesign the global ecosystem such that wild animal suffering ceases to exist"
" In the pursuit of abolishing suffering itself, Pearce promotes predation elimination among animals and the ""cross-species global analogue of the welfare state"""
" Fertility regulation could maintain herbivore populations at sustainable levels, ""a more civilised and compassionate policy option than famine, predation, and disease"""
 The increasing number of vegans and vegetarians in the transhumanism movement has been attributed in part to Pearce's influence
"A growing political philosophy that incorporates veganism as part of its revolutionary praxis is veganarchism, which seeks ""total abolition"" or ""total liberation"" for all animals, including humans"
" Veganarchists identify the state as unnecessary and harmful to animals, both human and non-human, and advocate for the adoption of a vegan lifestyle within a stateless society"
 The term was popularized in 1995 with Brian A
" Dominick's pamphlet Animal Liberation and Social Revolution, described as ""a vegan perspective on anarchism or an anarchist perspective on veganism"""
"Direct action is a common practice among veganarchists (and anarchists generally) with groups like the Animal Liberation Front (ALF), the Animal Rights Militia (ARM), the Justice Department (JD) and Revolutionary Cells – Animal Liberation Brigade (RCALB) often engaging in such activities, sometimes criminally, to further their goals"
" Steven Best, animal rights activist and professor of philosophy at the University of Texas at El Paso, is an advocate of this approach, and has been critical of vegan activists like Francione for supporting animal liberation, but not total liberation, which would include not only opposition to ""the property status of animals"", but also ""a serious critique of capitalism, the state, property relations, and commodification dynamics in general"
""" In particular, he criticizes the focus on the simplistic and apolitical ""Go Vegan"" message directed mainly at wealthy Western audiences, while ignoring people of color, the working class and the poor, especially in the developing world, noting that ""for every person who becomes vegan, a thousand flesh eaters arise in China, India and Indonesia"
""" The ""faith in the singular efficacy of conjectural education and moral persuasion,"" Best writes, is no substitute for ""direct action, mass confrontation, civil disobedience, alliance politics, and struggle for radical change"
""" Donald Watson has stated that he ""respects the people enormously who do it, believing that it's the most direct and quick way to achieve their ends"
"Some vegans also embrace the philosophy of anti-natalism, as they see the two as complementary in terms of ""harm reduction"" to animals and the environment"
"Vegan social psychologist Melanie Joy described the ideology in which people support the use and consumption of animal products as carnism, as a sort of opposite to veganism"
"The Vegan Society has written, ""by extension, [veganism] promotes the development and use of animal-free alternatives for the benefit of humans"
""" Many ethical vegans and vegan organizations cite the poor working conditions of slaughterhouse workers as a reason to reject animal products"
" The first vegan activist, Donald Watson, has stated, ""If these butchers and vivisectors weren't there, could we perform the acts that they are doing? And, if we couldn't, we have no right to expect them to do it on our behalf"
 Full stop! That simply compounds the issue
 It means that we're not just exploiting animals; we're exploiting human beings
"Environmental vegans focus on conservation, rejecting the use of animal products on the premise that fishing, hunting, trapping and farming, particularly factory farming, are environmentally unsustainable"
" In 2010, Paul Watson of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society called pigs and chicken ""major aquatic predators"", because livestock eat 40 percent of the fish that are caught"
" Since 2002[update], all Sea Shepherd ships have been vegan for environmental reasons"
 This specific form of veganism focuses its way of living on how to have a sustainable way of life without consuming animals
"According to a 2006 United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization report, Livestock's Long Shadow, around 26% of the planet's terrestrial surface is devoted to livestock grazing"
" The UN report also concluded that livestock farming (mostly of cows, chickens and pigs) affects the air, land, soil, water, biodiversity and climate change"
" Livestock consumed 1,174 million tonnes of food in 2002—including 7"
"6 million tonnes of fishmeal and 670 million tonnes of cereals, one-third of the global cereal harvest"
 A 2017 study published in the journal Carbon Balance and Management found animal agriculture's global methane emissions are 11% higher than previous estimates based on data from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
 A 2018 study found that global adoption of plant-based diets would reduce agricultural land use by 76% (3
"1 billion hectares, an area the size of Africa) and cut total global greenhouse gas emissions by 28% (half of this emissions reduction came from avoided emissions from animal production including methane and nitrous oxide, and half came from trees re-growing on abandoned farmland which remove carbon dioxide from the air), although other research has questioned these results"
"A 2010 UN report, Assessing the Environmental Impacts of Consumption and Production, argued that animal products ""in general require more resources and cause higher emissions than plant-based alternatives"""
:80 It proposed a move away from animal products to reduce environmental damage
"[s] A 2007 Cornell University study concluded that vegetarian diets use the least land per capita, but require higher quality land than is needed to feed animals"
" A 2015 study determined that significant biodiversity loss can be attributed to the growing demand for meat, which is a significant driver of deforestation and habitat destruction, with species-rich habitats being converted to agriculture for livestock production"
" A 2017 study by the World Wildlife Fund found that 60% of biodiversity loss can be attributed to the vast scale of feed crop cultivation needed to rear tens of billions of farm animals, which puts an enormous strain on natural resources resulting in an extensive loss of lands and species"
" Livestock make up 60% of the biomass of all mammals on earth, followed by humans (36%) and wild mammals (4%)"
" As for birds, 70% are domesticated, such as poultry, whereas only 30% are wild"
" In November 2017, 15,364 world scientists signed a warning to humanity calling for, among other things, ""promoting dietary shifts towards mostly plant-based foods"""
" The 2019 IPBES Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services found that industrial agriculture and overfishing are the primary drivers of the extinction crisis, with the meat and dairy industries having a substantial impact"
" On August 8, 2019, the IPCC released a summary of the 2019 special report which asserted that a shift towards plant-based diets would help to mitigate and adapt to climate change"
One of the leading activists and scholars of feminist animal rights is Carol J
" Her premier work, The Sexual Politics of Meat: A Feminist-Vegetarian Critical Theory (1990), sparked what became a feminist movement in animal rights, as she noted the relationship between feminism and meat consumption"
" Since the release of The Sexual Politics of Meat, Adams has published several other works, including essays, books, and keynote addresses"
" In one of her speeches, ""Why feminist-vegan now?""—adapted from her original address at the ""Minding Animals"" conference in Newcastle, Australia (2009)—Adams stated that ""the idea that there was a connection between feminism and vegetarianism came to [her] in October 1974"", illustrating that the concept of feminist veganism has been around for nearly half a century"
 Other authors have echoed Adams' ideas while also expanding on them
" Feminist scholar Angella Duvnjak stated in ""Joining the Dots: Some Reflections on Feminist-Vegan Political Practice and Choice"" that she was met with opposition when she pointed out the connection between feminist and vegan ideals, even though the connection seemed more than obvious to her and other scholars (2011)"
One of the central concepts that animates feminist veganism is the idea that there is a connection between the oppression of women and the oppression of animals
" For example, Marjorie Spiegal compared the consumption or servitude of animals for human gain to slavery"
" This connection is further mirrored by feminist vegan writers like Carrie Hamilton, who pointed out that violent ""rapists sometimes exhibit behavior that seems to be patterned on the mutilation of animals"" suggesting there is a parallel between the violence of rape and animal cruelty"
Feminist veganism also relates to feminist thought through the common critique of the capitalist means of production
 In an interview with Carol J
" Adams, she highlighted ""meat eating as the ultimate capitalist product, because it takes so much to make the product, it uses up so many resources"""
 This extensive use of resources for meat production is discouraged in favor of using that productive capacity for other food products that have a less detrimental impact on the environment
"Streams within a number of religious traditions encourage veganism, sometimes on ethical or environmental grounds"
  Scholars have especially noted the growth in the twenty-first century of Jewish veganism and Jain veganism
" Some interpretations of Christian vegetarianism, Hindu vegetarianism, and Buddhist vegetarianism also recommend or mandate a vegan diet"
"Donald Watson argued, ""If Jesus were alive today, he'd be an itinerant vegan propagandist instead of an itinerant preacher of those days, spreading the message of compassion, which, as I see it, is the only useful part of what religion has to offer and, sad as it seems, I doubt if we have to enroll our priest as a member of the Vegan Society"
"In some countries, vegans have some rights to meals and legal protections against discrimination"
Multiple symbols have been developed to represent veganism
" Several are used on consumer packaging, including the Vegan Society trademark and the Vegan Action logo, to indicate products without animal-derived ingredients"
" Various symbols may also be used by members of the vegan community to represent their identity and in the course of animal rights activism,[citation needed] such as a vegan flag"
"The documentary film Cowspiracy estimates that a vegan, over the course of one year, will save 1"
"5 million litres of water, 6,607 kg of grain, 1,022 square metres of forest cover, 3,322 kg of CO2, and 365 animal lives compared to the average U"
"[scholarly source needed] According to a 2016 study, if everyone in the U"
" switched to a vegan diet, the country would save $208"
"2 billion in direct health-care savings, $40"
"5 billion in indirect health-care savings, $40"
"5 billion in environmental savings, and $289"
1 billion in total savings by 2050
" The study also found that if everybody in the world switched to a vegan diet, the global economy would save $684"
"4 billion in direct health-care savings, $382"
"6 billion in indirect health-care savings, $569"
"5 billion in environmental savings, and $1"
63 trillion in total savings by 2050
"In his 2015 book Doing Good Better, William MacAskill stated the following (citing numbers from a 2011 book, Compassion by the pound):"

Environmental vegetarianism is the practice of vegetarianism when motivated by the desire to create a sustainable diet that avoids the negative environmental impact of meat production
 Livestock as a whole is estimated to be responsible for around 18% of global greenhouse gas emissions
"[a] As a result, significant reduction in meat consumption has been advocated by, among others, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  in their 2019 special report and as part of the 2017 World Scientists' Warning to Humanity"
"Other than climate change, environmental concerns about the production of animal products may also relate to pollution, deforestation, unsustainability and the use of water and land"
Four-fifths of agricultural emissions arise from the livestock sector
"According to the 2006 Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) report Livestock's Long Shadow, animal agriculture contributes on a ""massive scale"" to global warming, air pollution, land degradation, energy use, deforestation, and biodiversity decline"
" The FAO report estimates that the livestock (including poultry) sector (which provides draft animal power, leather, wool, milk, eggs, fertilizer, pharmaceuticals, etc"
", in addition to meat) contributes about 18 percent of global GHG emissions expressed as 100-year CO2 equivalents"
"[b] This estimate was based on life-cycle analysis, including feed production, land use changes, etc"
", and used GWP (global warming potential) of 23 for methane and 296 for nitrous oxide, to convert emissions of these gases to 100-year CO2 equivalents"
" The FAO report concluded that ""the livestock sector emerges as one of the top two or three most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems, at every scale from local to global"""
" The report found that livestock's contribution to greenhouse gas emissions was greater than that of the global transportation sector; this conclusion was criticized in 2010 by Frank Mitloehner of the University of California, Davis, who noted that the authors had not performed a similar life-cycle analysis for transportation, causing the relative contribution of animal agriculture to be overestimated"
"A 2009 study by the Worldwatch Institute argued that the FAO's report had underestimated impacts related to methane, land use and respiration, placing livestock at 51% of total global emissions"
According to a 2002 paper:
"The industrial agriculture system consumes fossil fuel, water, and topsoil at unsustainable rates"
" It contributes to numerous forms of environmental degradation, including air and water pollution, soil depletion, diminishing biodiversity, and fish die-offs"
" Meat production contributes disproportionately to these problems, in part because feeding grain to livestock to produce meat—instead of feeding it directly to humans—involves a large energy loss, making animal agriculture more resource intensive than other forms of food production"
 One personal act that can have a profound impact on these issues is reducing meat consumption
" To produce 1 pound of feedlot beef requires about 2,400 gallons of water and 7 pounds of grain (42)"
" Considering that the average American consumes 97 pounds of beef (and 273 pounds of meat in all) each year, even modest reductions in meat consumption in such a culture would substantially reduce the burden on our natural resources"
"The environmental impacts of animal production vary with the method of production, although ""[overall] impacts of the lowest-impact animal products typically exceed those of vegetable substitutes"""
"A 2017 study published in the journal Carbon Balance and Management found animal agriculture's global methane emissions are 11% higher than previous estimates, based on data from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change"
"A 2003 paper published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, after calculating effects on energy, land, and water use, concluded that meat-based diets require more resources and are less sustainable than lacto-ovo vegetarian diets"
" ""The water required for a meat-eating diet is twice as much needed for a 2,000-litre-a-day vegetarian diet"""
"According to Cornell University scientists: ""The heavy dependence on fossil energy suggests that the US food system, whether meat-based or plant-based, is not sustainable"""
" However, they also write: ""The meat-based food system requires more energy, land, and water resources than the lactoovovegetarian diet"
" In this limited sense, the lactoovovegetarian diet is more sustainable than the average American meat-based diet"
""" One of these Cornell scientists has advised that the US could feed 800 million people with grain that livestock eat"
" He ""depicted grain-fed livestock farming as a costly and nonsustainable way to produce animal protein"", but ""distinguished grain-fed meat production from pasture-raised livestock, calling cattle-grazing a more reasonable use of marginal land"""
"The use of ever increasing amounts of land for meat production and livestock rearing instead of plants and grains for human diets is, according to sociologist David Nibert, ""a leading cause of malnutrition, hunger, and famine around the world"
David Attenborough
Another agricultural effect is on land degradation
 Cattle are a known cause for soil erosion through trampling of the ground and overgrazing
 Much of the world's crops are used to feed animals
" With 30 percent of the earth's land devoted to raising livestock, a major cutback is needed to keep up with growing population"
" Demand for meat is expected to double by 2050; in China, for example, where vegetable-based diets were once the norm, demand for meat will continue to be great in absolute terms, even though demand growth will slow"
" As countries are developing, incomes are increasing, and consumption of animal products is associated with prosperity"
 This growing demand is unsustainable
A grazing-based production can limit soil erosion and also allow farmers to control pests with less pesticides by rotating crops with grass
" However, in arid areas, this may catalyze a desertification process"
 The ability of soil to absorb water by infiltration is important for minimizing runoff and soil erosion
 Researchers in Iowa reported that a soil under perennial pasture grasses grazed by livestock was able to absorb far more water than the same kind of soil under two annual crops: corn and soybeans
Biomass of mammals on Earth
"The 2019 IPBES Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services found that the primary driver of biodiversity loss is human land use, which deprives other species of land needed for their survival, with the meat industry playing a significant role in this process"
 Around 25% of earth's ice-free land is used for cattle rearing
 Other studies have also warned that meat consumption is accelerating mass extinctions globally
 A 2017 study by the World Wildlife Fund attributed 60% of biodiversity loss to the land needed to rear tens of billions of farm animals
"A May 2018 study stated that while wildlife has been decimated since the dawn of human civilization, with wild mammals plummeting by 83%, livestock populations reared by humans for consumption have increased"
" Livestock make up 60% of the biomass of all mammals on earth, followed by humans (36%) and wild mammals (4%)"
" As for birds, 70% are domesticated, such as poultry, whereas only 30% are wild"
Animal production has a large impact on water pollution and usage
" According to the Water Education Foundation, it takes 2,464 gallons of water to produce one pound of beef in California, whereas it takes only 25 gallons of water to produce one pound of wheat"
" Raising a large amount of livestock creates a massive amount of manure and urine, which can pollute natural resources by changing the pH of water, contaminates the air, and emits a major amount of gas that directly affects global warming"
" As most livestock are raised in small confined spaces to cut down on cost, this increases the problem of concentrated waste"
 Livestock in the United States produces 2
"7 trillion pounds of manure each year, which is ten times more than what is produced by the entire U"
" There are issues with how animal waste is disposed, as some is used as fertilizer while some farmers create manure lagoons which store millions of gallons of animal waste which is extremely unsafe and detrimental to the environment"
"Worldwatch Institute, an independent environmental research institute"
"Although motivations frequently overlap, environmental vegetarians and vegans can be contrasted with those who are primarily motivated by concerns about animal welfare (one kind of ethical vegetarianism), health, or who avoid meat to save money or out of necessity (economic vegetarianism)"
" Some also believe vegetarianism will improve global food security, or curb starvation"
"A study in Climate Change concluded ""if "
" average diets among UK adults conformed to WHO recommendations, their associated GHG emissions would be reduced by 17%"
" Further GHG emission reductions of around 40% could be achieved by making realistic modifications to diets so that they contain fewer animal products and processed snacks and more fruit, vegetables and cereals"
""" A study in The Lancet estimated that the ""30% reduction in livestock production"" by 2030 required to meet the UK Committee on Climate Change's agricultural would also result in a roughly 15% decrease in ischaemic heart disease"
"Environmental vegetarians call for a reduction of first world consumption of meat, especially in the US"
" According to the United Nations Population Fund, ""Each U"
 citizen consumes an average of 260 lbs
" of meat per year, the world's highest rate"
 That is about 1
"5 times the industrial world average, three times the East Asian average, and 40 times the average in Bangladesh"
""" In addition, ""the ecological footprint of an average person in a high-income country is about six times bigger than that of someone in a low-income country, and many more times bigger than in the least-developed countries"""
A 2018 report published in PNAS asserted that farmers in the United States could sustain more than twice as many people than they do currently if they abandoned rearing farm animals for human consumption and instead focused on growing plants
"The World Health Organization calls malnutrition ""the silent emergency"", and says that it is a factor in at least half of the 10"
4 million child deaths which occur every year
"Some[who?] argue that the adoption of an ovo-lacto vegetarian or entirely plant-based vegan diet is best, but may not be totally necessary, because even modest reductions in meat consumption in industrialized societies would substantially reduce the burden on natural resources"
" For developed countries, a CAST report estimates an average of 2"
6 pounds of grain feed per pound of beef carcass meat produced
" For developing countries, the estimate is 0"
3 pounds per pound
 (Some very dissimilar figures are sometimes seen; the CAST report discusses common sources of error and discrepancies among such figures
") In 2007, US per capita beef consumption was 62"
"2 pounds per year, and US per capita meat (red meat plus fish plus poultry) consumption totaled 200"
7 pounds (boneless trimmed weight basis)
"Globalization and modernization has resulted in Western consumer cultures spreading to countries like China and India, including meat-intensive diets which are supplanting traditional plant-based diets"
" More than 200 billion animals are consumed by a global population of over 7 billion annually, which philosopher and animal rights activist Steven Best argues is ""completely unsustainable"""
" A 2018 study published in Science states that meat consumption is set to increase by some 76% by 2050 as the result of human population growth and rising affluence, which will increase greenhouse gas emissions and further reduce biodiversity"
"A 2018 report in Nature found that a significant reduction in meat consumption is necessary to mitigate climate change, especially as the population rises to a projected 10 billion in the coming decades"
" According to a 2019 report in The Lancet, global meat consumption needs to be reduced by 50 percent to mitigate for climate change"
"In November 2017, 15,364 world scientists signed a Warning to Humanity calling for, among other things, drastically diminishing our per capita consumption of meat"
A 2010 report from the United Nations Environment Programme's (UNEP) International Panel of Sustainable Resource Management stated:
Impacts from agriculture are expected to increase substantially due to population growth and increasing consumption of animal products
" Unlike fossil fuels, it is difficult to look for alternatives: people have to eat"
" A substantial reduction of impacts would only be possible with a substantial worldwide diet change, away from animal products"
The aforementioned Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services also suggested that a reduction in meat consumption would be required to help preserve biodiversity
"According to a July 2019 report by the World Resources Institute the global population will increase to roughly 10 billion by the middle of the century, with demand for ruminant meat rising by 88%"
 The report posits that Americans and Europeans will need to reduce their beef consumption by 40% and 22% respectively in order to feed so many people and at the same time avert an ecological catastrophe
"In November 2019, a warning on the ""climate emergency"" from over 11,000 scientists from over 100 countries said that ""eating mostly plant-based foods while reducing the global consumption of animal products, especially ruminant livestock, can improve human health and significantly lower GHG emissions (including methane in the “Short-lived pollutants” step)"
""" The warning also says it this will ""free up croplands for growing much-needed human plant food instead of livestock feed, while releasing some grazing land to support natural climate solutions"
"A 2020 study by researchers from the University of Michigan and Tulane University, which was commissioned by the Center for Biological Diversity, asserts that if the U"
" cut its meat consumption by half, it could result in diet-related GHG emissions being reduced by 35%, a decline of 1"
Bill Mollison has argued in his Permaculture Design Course that vegetarianism exacerbates soil erosion
" This is because removing a plant from a field removes all the nutrients it obtained from the soil, while removing an animal leaves the field intact"
" On US farmland, much less soil erosion is associated with pastureland used for livestock grazing than with land used for production of crops"
" Robert Hart has also developed forest gardening, which has since been adopted as a common permaculture design element, as a sustainable plant-based food production system"
Some environmental activists claim that adopting a vegetarian diet may be a way of focusing on personal actions and righteous gestures rather than systemic change
" Environmentalist Dave Riley states that ""being meatless and guiltless seems seductively simple while environmental destruction rages around us"", and notes that Mollison ""insists that vegetarianism drives animals from the edible landscape so that their contribution to the food chain is lost"""
"According to a study published in PNAS, U"
 GHG emissions would only be decreased by 2
6% (or 28% of agricultural GHG emissions) if animals were completely removed from U
 agriculture and diets
 This study's underlying assumptions however were heavily criticized
 In a followup letter the authors refuted the criticism and defended their work
Vegetarian and vegan dietary practices vary among countries
" Differences include food standards, laws, and general cultural attitudes of vegetarian diets"
"Some countries have strong cultural or religious traditions that promote vegetarianism, such as India, while other countries have secular ethical concerns, including animal rights, environmental protection, and health concerns"
" In many countries, food labelling laws make it easier for vegetarians to identify foods compatible with their diets"

"While the prevalence of strict ethical vegetarianism in Africa is reported to be low since most of the traditional food consists of meat, there are a few vegetarian traditions in the African continent"
Vegan dishes are commonplace in Ethiopian cuisine due to mandates by the Ethiopian Orthodox Church and Egyptian Coptic Christianity that require weekly fasting days (fasting in this context is abstaining from all meat products)
"Countries in North Africa have a tradition of cooking in a vegetarian style, with Morocco, Algeria, Libya and Tunisia being particularly connected with this type of cooking which includes couscous and spiced vegetables"
Hindu and Jain immigrants from India brought vegetarianism with them
 This trend has been documented as far back as 1895 in Natal Province
"As the majority of the population of Mauritius is Hindu, vegetarianism is common and vegetarian cuisine is widely available in restaurants"
"In China, a small but growing number of young people in large cities are vegan"
 An estimated 4 to 5 percent of Chinese are vegetarian
"Chinese folk religion, which is distinct from Taoism, Chinese salvationist religions, and New Religious Movements is similar to Shintoism in Japan insofar as while the killing and eating of animals is not forbidden, it is considered impure and not ideal for a believer"
" Tofu, soy milk, and seitan, which are popular among vegetarians in the world, originate in China"
Classical Chinese texts pointed to a period of abstinence from meat before undertaking matters of great importance or of religious significance
" People typically abstain from meat periodically, particularly the day before Chinese New Year"
" Although it's more common among adherents of Chinese folk religions, many secular people also do this"
"With the influx of Buddhist influences, vegetarianism became more popular, but there is a distinction—Taoist vegetarianism is based on a perception of purity, while Buddhist vegetarianism is based on the dual bases of refraining from killing and subduing one's own subservience to the senses"
"  Because of this, two types of ""vegetarianism"" came to be—one where one refrained from eating meat, the other being refraining from eating meat as well as garlic, onions, and other such strongly flavored foods"
  This Buddhism-influenced vegetarianism has been known and practiced by some since at least the 7th century
 People who are Buddhist may also avoid eating eggs
"The early 20th century saw some intellectuals espousing vegetarianism as part of their program for reforming China culturally, not just politically"
" The anarchist thinker Li Shizeng, for instance, argued that tofu and soy products were healthier and could be a profitable export"
" Liang Shuming, a philosopher and reform activist, adopted a basically vegetarian diet, but did not promote one for others"
" In recent years, it has seen a resurgence in the cities among the emerging middle class"
India has more vegetarians than the rest of the world put together
" In 2007, UN FAO statistics indicated that Indians had the lowest rate of meat consumption in the world"
 Vegetarians in India have been demanding meat-free supermarkets
" In Indian cuisine, vegetarianism is usually synonymous with lacto vegetarianism"
" Most restaurants in India clearly distinguish and market themselves as being either ""non-vegetarian"", ""vegetarian"", or ""pure vegetarian"""
" Vegetarian restaurants abound, and many vegetarian options are usually available"
" Animal-based ingredients (other than milk and honey) such as lard, gelatin, and meat stock are not used in the traditional cuisine"
" India has devised a system of marking edible products made from only vegetarian ingredients, with a green dot in a green square"
" A mark of a brown dot in a brown square conveys that some animal-based ingredients (meat, egg, etc"
" Products like honey, milk, or its direct derivatives are categorized under the green mark"

 Other surveys cited by FAO and USDA estimate 40% of the Indian population as being vegetarian
" These surveys indicate that even Indians who do eat meat, do so infrequently, with less than 30% consuming it regularly, although the reasons are mainly cultural"
" In states where vegetarianism is more common, milk consumption is higher and is associated with lactase persistence"
" This allows people to continue consuming milk into adulthood and obtain proteins that are substituted for meat, fish and eggs in other areas"
" An official survey conducted by the Government of India, with a sample size of 8858 and the census frame as 2011, indicated India's vegetarian population to be 28-29% of the total population"

" The vegetarian households have higher income, consumption and more affluent than meat-eating households, the upper-caste eat meat less frequently as they become richer and the lower castes, dalits and tribes-people are mainly meat eaters according to National Family Health Survey (NFHS)"
" The study argues that meat-eating behavior is underreported because consumption of meat, especially beef, is ""caught in cultural, political, and group identity struggles in India"""
 Vegetarianism is less common amongst non-Hindu Indian religious groups such as Muslims and Christians
 Vegetarianism is most common amongst Sikhs and Jains in India
" Increases in meat consumption in India have been attributed to urbanisation, increasing disposable income, consumerism and cross-cultural influences"

"As in Canada, vegetarianismo (Portuguese pronunciation: [veʒiˌtaɾjɐ̃ˈnizmu]) is usually synonymous with lacto-ovo-vegetarianism, and vegetarians are sometimes wrongly assumed to be pescetarians and/or pollotarians who tolerate the flesh of fish or poultry, respectively"

"Economic vegetarians believe that nutrition can be acquired more efficiently and at a lower price through vegetables, grains, etc"
", rather than from meat"
" They argue that a vegetarian diet is rich in vitamins, dietary fiber, and complex carbohydrates, and carries with it fewer risks (such as heart disease, obesity, and bacterial infection) than animal flesh"
" Consequently, they consider the production of meat economically unsound"
Some vegetarians are motivated by a lifestyle of simple living or adopt vegetarianism through necessity
" For example, in the United Kingdom, necessity changed dietary habits during the period around World War II and the early 1950s, as animal products were strictly rationed and allotment or home-grown fruit and vegetables were readily available"
" Before that during World War I, Americans were encouraged to go one day of the week meatless in order to save meat rations for the troops, which began the ""Meatless Monday"" revolution"

70 increase over the last 31 years
" The majority of the price increase has happened between 2004 and 2016, increasing by $1"
72 over the 12-year period
 These price increases make it hard for low-income households to continue to include meat as a part of their diet
Many economic vegetarians also promote the idea that advanced agricultural techniques have made the production of meat outdated and inefficient
 Some promote the idea of synthetic and cloned meat
"Economic vegetarians frequently contrast themselves with mainstream vegetarians, most of whom abstain from animal products on religious or ethical grounds"
 They may be vegetarian for other reasons; and there may be significant overlap between these beliefs (e
 between economic and environmental vegetarians)
